               facilities necessary to adequately serve the impacts and demands of new residential
               development; and to require that future residential growth contribute its fair share

               reasonably anticipated to offset the impacts and demands generated by such growth.

               Fees are due and payable at the same time as the Road, Fire, or Police Impact Fee
               is paid.

            <p class="p0" align="left">
               The park impact fee is the sum of the local park open space fee (less a credit for
               fees and taxes paid toward capital expansion of local parks) and the local park improvement
               fee, together with impact fee administrative cost. This impact fee reflects the impact
               of residential development on both the need for local park open space and the need
               for improvements to local park property. Any person requesting a building permit for
               residential development shall pay the impact fee reflected in the impact fee schedule
