            maintain and operate in, under, upon, over and across the present and future streets,

            and incorporated areas of Dade County, Florida (herein called the "Grantor") and its
            successors, in accordance with established practice with respect to electrical construction
            and maintenance, for the period of thirty (30) years from the effective date hereof,
            electric light and power facilities (including conduits, poles, wires and transmission
            lines, and, for its own use, telephone and telegraph lines) for the purpose of supplying
            electricity to the Grantor, its successors, the inhabitants thereof, and persons and
            corporations beyond the limits thereof, subject to all franchises in existence on
            the effective date hereof which have been granted to the Grantee by municipalities
            within the limits of Dade County, Florida, including any renewals or extensions of
            such municipal franchises, and subject to any franchises which may be granted to the
            Grantee by any municipality which was incorporated within Dade County prior to the
            effective date hereof.

            <i>Section 2.</i> The facilities of the Grantee shall be so located or relocated and so erected as
            to interfere as little as possible with traffic over said streets, alleys, bridges
            and public places, and with reasonable egress from and ingress to abutting property.
            The location or relocation of all facilities shall be made under the supervision and
            with the approval of such representatives as the governing body of the Grantor may
            designate for the purpose, but not so as to unreasonably interfere with the proper
            operation of the Grantee's facilities and service. When any portion of a street is
            excavated by the Grantee in the location or relocation of any of its facilities, the
            portion of the street so excavated shall, within a reasonable time and as early as
            practicable after such excavation, be replaced by the Grantee at its expense and in
            condition as good as it was at the time of such excavation. Provided, however, that
            nothing in this Section shall be construed to make the Grantor liable to the Grantee
            for any cost or expense in connection with the construction, reconstruction, repair
            or relocation of the Grantee's conduits, poles, towers and appurtenances thereto in
            streets, highways, alleys, bridges, and other public places of the Grantor made necessary
            by widening, grading, paving, or otherwise improving by said Grantor, of any of the
            present and future streets, avenues, alleys, highways, bridges, easements and other
            public places used or occupied by the Grantee hereunder, which shall be at the cost
            of the Grantee, except, however, Grantee shall be entitled to reimbursement of its
            costs as may be provided by law.

            hereunder, and the acceptance of this ordinance shall be deemed an agreement on the
            part of the Grantee to indemnify the Grantor and hold it harmless against any and
            all liability, loss, cost, damage or expense which may accrue to the Grantor by reason
            of the negligence, default or misconduct of the Grantee in the construction, operation
            or maintenance of its facilities hereunder.

            all times be subject to such regulation as may be provided by law.

            of the provisions of this ordinance shall be grounds for forfeiture of this grant,
            but no such forfeiture shall take effect if the reasonableness or propriety thereof

            appeal in either party) shall have found that the Grantee has failed to comply in

            discretion to grant such additional time to the Grantee for compliance as necessities
            in the case require. Provided, however, that the provisions of this Section shall
            not be construed as impairing any alternative right or rights which the Grantor may
            have with respect to the forfeiture of franchises under the Constitution or the general
