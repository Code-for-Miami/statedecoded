               concurrency requirements of the Local Government Comprehensive Planning and Land Development

               legal responsibility and authority to provide, or cause to be provided, safe and sanitary
               solid waste collection, transportation, and disposal services within Miami-Dade County
               in accordance with Article VIII, Section 6(1)(e), of the 1968 Florida Constitution
               and Article 1, Section 1.01(9) and (21), Miami-Dade County Home Rule Charter. Moreover,<a href="../level2/PTICOAMCH_ART1BOCOCO.html#PTICOAMCH_ART1BOCOCO_S1.01PO"> Section 1.01</a>(9) of the Miami-Dade County Home Rule Charter specifically provides the Board of

               further finds and declares that collection, transportation, and disposal of solid
               waste generated in the Disposal Facility Fee Area are essential public services. The
               Board further finds and declares that imposition of a Disposal Facility Fee on private
               haulers operating in the Disposal Facility Fee Area is the best and most practical

               in the solid waste collection service area and in municipalities served by the County
               are required to have accumulations of garbage, bulky waste, and solid waste removed

               and are hereby imposed as, special assessment liens against the real property aforesaid,
               and until fully paid and discharged, or barred by law, shall remain liens equal in
               rank and dignity with the lien of County ad valorem taxes and superior in rank and
               dignity to all other liens, encumbrances, titles and claims in, to or against the
               real property involved. Unless otherwise provided herein, such waste fees shall become
               delinquent if not fully paid within sixty (60) days after the due date. All delinquent
               waste fees billed and collected by the Department shall bear a penalty of eighteen
               (18) percent, and if not fully paid with all accrued penalty assessments by the due
               date of the next succeeding waste fee payment, an additional eighteen (18) percent
               penalty shall be added successively for each period until fully paid. Unpaid and delinquent
               waste fees, together with all penalties imposed thereon, shall remain and constitute
               special assessment liens against the real property involved for the period of five
               (5) years from the due date thereof. Provided, however, that any tax certificates
               which include delinquent waste fees shall remain valid pursuant to the provisions
               of Section 197.241 of the Florida Statutes, as amended. Such special assessment liens
               for waste fees and penalties may be enforced by any of the methods provided in Chapter
               86, Florida Statutes, or in the alternative, foreclosure proceedings may be instituted
               and prosecuted under the provisions of Chapter 173, Florida Statutes, or the collection
               and enforcement of payment thereof may be accompanied by any other method authorized
               by law. Provided that special assessments imposed under the provisions of this chapter
               on residential units shall be deemed due, become delinquent, receive discounts, bear
               interest and be collected in the same manner and subject to the same provisions of
               law as are ad valorem taxes.
