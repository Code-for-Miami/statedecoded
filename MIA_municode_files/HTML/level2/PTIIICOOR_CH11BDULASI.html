            <p class="p0" align="left">
               The County Commission finds and declares that disposal of a considerable portion of
               combustible waste materials and refuse in Dade County is accomplished by the operation
               of dumps and landfill sites in Dade County, and further finds and declares that the
               operation of such dumps and landfill sites necessarily involves a high risk of fires.
               The County Commission finds and declares that because of the large size of the dumps
               and landfill sites, a fire thereon becomes an extreme hazard to the health, safety
               and welfare of the community, in that such a fire produces great and abnormal quantities
               of smoke. The County Commission finds and declares that such smoke creates a hazardous
               condition in the community by: (1) seriously reducing visibility of the highways and
               streets, thus jeopardizing the safety of the motorists, pedestrians, and residents;
               (2) seriously reducing visibility in the air, thus jeopardizing the safe operation
               of aircraft and endangering passengers' lives and cargo and the lives of residents
               of the community; and (3) polluting the air and endangering the health of residents.
               The County Commission finds and declares that a fire itself on a dump or landfill
               site subjects surrounding lands to fires and thus endangers the lives and properties
               of the owners thereof. The County Commission finds and declares that in order to protect
               the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of this community from the hazards
               of smoke and fires resulting from the use of dumps and landfill sites, it is necessary
               to impose minimum requirements upon the operation of dumps or landfill sites to avoid
               the possibility of fires thereon and to expedite the extinguishing of fires which
               may occur thereon. Further, the County Commission finds and declares that in order
               to insure compliance with such minimum requirements, it is necessary to require persons
               operating or causing to be operated a dump or landfill site to obtain a permit therefor,
               which permit shall be issued only upon a satisfactory showing of compliance with such
               minimum requirements.
