               <i>Authority of Community Zoning Appeals Board.</i> The County's Community Zoning Appeals Board may authorize a variance from these regulations.
               The Community Zoning Appeals Board may vary the regulations so that substantial justice
               may be done, provided that such variance will not have the effect of nullifying the
               intent and purpose of the overall community plan. In granting any variance, the County's
               Community Zoning Appeals Board shall prescribe any conditions that are deemed necessary
               to or desirable for the public interest. In making its findings, the Community Zoning
               Appeals Board shall take into account among other things the nature of the proposed
               use of the land and the exiting use of the land in the vicinity, the number of persons
               to reside or work in the proposed subdivision and the probable effect of the proposed
               subdivision upon traffic conditions in the vicinity. No variance shall be granted
               unless the County's Community Zoning Appeals Board finds, among other things, that
               all three (3) of the following conditions exist in regard to the land concerned:
