               The Board finds and determines that the neglect of property by property owners and
               the rapid, continuous growth and urban development of the unincorporated areas of
               this County require the reasonable and effective control and regulation of excessive
               growth and accumulation of weeds, and other certain plant life to the extent and in
               such manner as to cause infestation by rodents and feral animals, the breeding of
               mosquitoes and vermin, or to threaten or endanger the public health, or otherwise
               adversely affect the welfare of adjacent property or occupants. Further, the Board
               finds and determines that the accumulation of garbage and trash in violation of<a href="../level2/PTIIICOOR_CH15SOWAMA.html#PTIIICOOR_CH15SOWAMA"> Chapter 15</a>, Miami-Dade County Code requires reasonable and effective controls to protect the
               public health, safety and welfare of the community. Further, the Board finds that
               the maintenance of exterior premises of all improved property serves a public purpose
               in keeping property operating in a safe, sanitary and litter-free manner to prevent
               neighborhood blight and the deterioration of neighborhood character which, if unchecked,
               would have deleterious effect on the quality of life and the economic vitality of
               Miami-Dade County.
