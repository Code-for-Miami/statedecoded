               The coastal areas of Miami-Dade County, Florida, are subject to flooding resulting
               in danger to life, loss of property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce
               and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection
               and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public
               health, safety and general welfare. The Board of County Commissioners of Miami-Dade
               County, by Resolution No. R-671-69, adopted on May 28, 1969, expressed willingness
               to take action necessary to meet the objectives of the National Flood Insurance Act
               of 1968 within Miami-Dade County, Florida; and by Resolution No. R-912-70, adopted
               on July 24, 1970, reaffirmed its interest in securing flood insurance coverage under
               said act, and agreed to establish by December 31, 1971, measures required under the
               Federal Insurance Program. In August of 1970, the Federal Insurance Administration
               declared the entire area of Miami-Dade County eligible for federally assisted flood
               insurance, which insurance will mitigate the effects of damages from such natural
               disasters as hurricanes and severe storms and their attendant flooding. This chapter
               is adopted to insure the continued availability of said flood insurance; to comply
               with federally imposed requirements; and to protect the public health, safety and
               general welfare, by minimizing flood losses in the coastal areas of Miami-Dade County,
               and to require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such
               uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; control
               the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers
               which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters; control filling, grading,
               dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage; and to
               insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

Furthermore, the Director of the Department of

               annual report on variances granted shall be submitted to the National Flood Insurance
               Administration, which report is the basis for continued availability of flood insurance
               to the inhabitants of the unincorporated areas of Miami-Dade County, and therefore

               hereof will result in unnecessary hardship, and so the spirit of the regulations shall
               be observed and substantial justice done; provided, that the variance will be in harmony
