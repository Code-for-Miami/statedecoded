            <p class="content1">If an application for municipal zoning action filed in any incorporated area in Metropolitan
               Miami-Dade County, Florida, would allow, if granted, a development of County impact,
               as indicated herein, the application shall contain, in addition to such other matters
               as may be required, a statement that the applicant proposed to undertake a development
               of County impact within the incorporated area. The application for such a municipal
               zoning action shall be accompanied by a completed development impact statement in
               the same manner and form as required for developments in the unincorporated area of
               Metropolitan Miami-Dade County. If any applicant is in doubt as to whether his proposed
               development would be a development of County impact, he may request a determination
               from the Metropolitan Miami-Dade County Developmental Impact Committee. Within thirty
               (30) days of the receipt of such request, the chairman, on behalf of the Developmental
               Impact Committee, shall issue a letter of interpretation with respect to the proposed
               development. No developmental impact statement shall be required if a developmental
               impact statement pertaining to the same property had been filed within one (1) year
               preceding the filing date of the most recent application. This chapter shall not apply
               if the development activity would constitute a "development of regional impact" as
               defined by Chapter 380, Florida Statutes, 1972, for which a development order is required,
               or if the application seeks only site or plot use plan approval which does not involve
               district boundary changes, or if the application is located entirely within the boundaries
               of the Rapid Transit Developmental Impact Zone.

               to place the matter before the Board of County Commissioners for consideration and

               to which, the municipal authority has departed from the requirements of subsection
               (e) of this section. Where it appears that the action of the municipal authority is

               in and for Miami-Dade County, Florida, to contest the action of the municipal authority

               public hearing and action by the Board of County Commissioners cannot be held or undertaken
               within thirty (30) days after the ordinance, resolution or order is rendered, the
               County Manager is hereby delegated authority to instruct the County Attorney to file
               appropriate legal action as above set forth where it appears that the action of the
               municipal authority is substantially contrary to the recommendations of the Board
               of County Commissioners made pursuant to subsection (d) of this section. Thereafter,
               the matter shall be set before the Board of County Commissioners as aforesaid to determine
               if the action of the County Manager should be ratified or if the judicial proceeding
               undertaken by the County Attorney should be voluntarily dismissed.
