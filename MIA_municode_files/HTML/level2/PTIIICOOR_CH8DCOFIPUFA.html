            <p class="p0" align="left">
               The Board is hereby authorized to provide, by resolution or ordinance, at one (1)
               time or from time to time, for the issuance of either revenue bonds or general obligation
               bonds of the County for the purpose of paying all or a part of the cost of any one
               (1) or more projects as hereinabove defined. The bonds of each issue shall be dated,
               shall bear interest at such rate or rates, shall mature at such time or times not
               exceeding forty (40) years from their date or dates, all as may be determined by the
               Board, and may be made redeemable before maturity, at the option of the County, at
               such price or prices and under such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the Board
               prior to the issuance of the bonds. In fixing the interest rate which such bonds shall
               bear, there shall be no interest rate limitation. The Board shall determine the form
               of the bonds, including any interest coupons to be attached thereto, and the manner
               of execution of the bonds, and shall fix the denomination or denominations of the
               bonds and the place or places of payment of principal and interest, which may be at
               any bank or trust company within or without the State. In case any officer whose signature
               or a facsimile of whose signature shall appear on any bonds or coupons shall cease
               to be such officer before the delivery of such bonds, such signature or such facsimile
               shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if he had
               remained in office until such delivery. All bonds issued under the provisions of this
               chapter shall have, and are hereby declared to have, all the qualities and incidents
               of negotiable instruments under the negotiable instruments law of the State. The bonds
               may be issued in coupon or in registered form, or both, as the Board may determine,
               and provision may be made for the registration of any coupon bonds as to principal
               alone and also as to both principal and interest, and for the reconversion into coupon
               bonds of any bonds registered as to both principal and interest. The issuance of such
               bonds shall not be subject to any limitations or conditions contained in any other
               law, and the Board may sell such bonds in such manner, either at public or at private
               sale, and for such price, as it may determine to be in the best interests of the County.
               Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the Board may, under like restrictions,
               issue interim receipts or temporary bonds, with or without coupons, exchangeable for
               definitive bonds when such bonds have been executed and are available for delivery.
               The Board may also provide for the replacement of any bonds which shall become mutilated
               or be destroyed or lost.

               or the happening of any other condition or thing than those proceedings, conditions
               or things which are specifically required by this chapter.

               The proceeds of such bonds shall be used solely for the payment of the cost of the

               if any, as the Board may provide in the authorizing resolution or in the trust agreement
               securing such bonds. If the proceeds of such bonds, by error of estimates or otherwise,
               shall be less than such cost, additional bonds may in like manner be issued to provide
               the amount of such deficit and, unless otherwise provided in the authorizing resolution
               or in the trust agreement, shall be deemed to be of the same issue and shall be entitled
               to payment from the same fund, without preference or priority of the bonds first issued
               for the same purpose. If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue shall exceed the amount
               required for the purpose for which such bonds shall have been issued, the surplus
               shall be paid into the fund provided under the provisions of this chapter for the

               Revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this chapter shall not be deemed to constitute
               a pledge of the faith and credit of the County, but such bonds shall be payable solely
               from the funds provided therefor under the provisions of this chapter. All such bonds
               shall contain a statement on their face substantially to the effect that the County
               is not obligated to pay such bonds or the interest thereon except from such funds
               and that the faith and credit of the County are not pledged to the payment of the
               principal of or the interest on such bonds. The issuance of revenue bonds under the
               provisions of this chapter shall not directly or indirectly or contingently obligate
               the County or levy any taxes whatever therefor or to make any appropriation for their

               In the discretion of the Board, any issue of revenue bonds may be secured by a trust
               agreement by and between the County and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust
               company within or outside of the State. The resolution authorizing the issuance of
               the revenue bonds or such trust agreement shall pledge the revenues to be received,
               but shall not convey or mortgage any project or any part thereof, and may contain
               such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders
               as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting
               forth the duties of the County and of the Board in relation to the construction, reconstruction,
               improvement, maintenance, operation, repair and insurance of the project or projects,
               and provisions for the custody, safeguarding and application of all moneys, and for
               the employment of consulting engineers in connection with such construction, reconstruction
               or operation. Such resolution or trust agreement may set forth the rights and remedies
               of the bondholders, and may restrict the individual right of action by the bondholders
               as is customary in trust agreements or trust indentures securing bonds or debentures
               of corporations. In addition to the foregoing, such resolution or trust agreement
               may contain such other provisions as the Board may deem reasonable and proper for
               the security of bondholders. Except as in this chapter otherwise provided, the Board
               may provide for the payment of the proceeds of the sale of the bonds and the revenues
               of the project or projects to such officer, board or depositary as it may designate
               for the custody thereof, and for the method of disbursement thereof, with such safeguards
               and restrictions as it may determine. All expenses incurred in carrying out the provisions
               of such resolution or trust agreement may be treated as a part of the cost of operation.

            <p class="p0" align="left">
               The Board, for and on behalf of the County, is authorized to provide from time to
               time for the issuance of revenue bonds of the County to provide funds for the purpose
               of refunding any or all outstanding seaport revenue bonds of the County or for the
               combined purpose of so refunding and paying the cost of acquisition, construction,
               reconstruction, improvement, extension or enlargement of a project. Any such refunding
               may be effected by the County using the proceeds of its revenue bonds, together with
               any other available moneys, to purchase obligations of the federal government, the
               principal of and the interest on which when due will provide sufficient moneys to
               pay the principal, interest and redemption premium, if any, on the outstanding bonds
               to be refunded as the same become due, whether at their respective maturities or upon
               the date or dates selected for their redemption prior to maturity, and any associated
               expenses. For the purposes of this section, the Board, in its discretion, may elect
               in the proceedings authorizing such refunding bonds to redeem all the revenue bonds
               to be refunded on one (1) or more selected redemption dates or so to redeem same of
               bonds to be refunded and to allow the balance of the bonds to be refunded to mature
               in accordance with their original principal payment schedule or to allow all of the
               bonds to be refunded to mature in accordance with their original principal payment
               schedule; provided, that in any case the redemption and the payments at maturity,
               together with interest and any redemption premium, will be provided from the proceeds
               of the revenue bonds authorized by this section, investment earnings thereon and any
               other available moneys. In connection with any such refunding, the County may enter
               into contractual arrangements deemed necessary or desirable by the Board with banks
               or other fiduciaries as to the escrowing, investment and application of refunding
               revenue bond proceeds, revenues of the County's seaport and any other available funds.
