               The Board of County Commissioners of Miami-Dade County, Florida, hereby finds and
               declares that in recent years and at present an increased number of vacant structures
               exists, especially in buildings which house multiple families, the maintenance and
               appearance of which are often neglected by the owners thereof, It is furthermore found
               and declared by this Board that said vacant structures often become open, unsecured,
               vandalized, or used for illicit purposes by trespassers, resulting in conditions that
               are unhealthy, unsafe, unsightly, and a blight upon the neighborhood and the community
               at large, and that the establishment of minimum standards for the maintenance and
               appearance of vacant structures will improve the security and quality of life in general
               of persons living nearby, will prevent blight and decay, and will safeguard the public
               health, safety, morals and welfare.

               The intent and purpose of this chapter is to protect the public health, safety, morals
               and welfare of all the people of Metropolitan Miami-Dade County, Florida, by establishing
               minimum standards governing the maintenance and appearance of vacant structures; fixing
               certain responsibilities and duties of owners, operators and agents of vacant structures;
               authorizing and establishing procedures for the inspection of vacant structures; fixing
               penalties for the violation of the provisions of this chapter; setting forth a procedure
               for enforcement of this chapter and for the granting of variances to the enforcement
               of the provisions of this chapter in cases of extreme hardship, when the health, safety,
               welfare and morals of the neighborhood, community and the public at large will not
               be detrimentally affected thereby, and where literal enforcement of this chapter would
               offer no meaningful benefit or advantage to the neighborhood, community and public

               to make inspections to determine the condition of vacant commercial structures, vacant
               dwellings, vacant dwelling units, vacant rooming houses, vacant rooming units, vacant
               hotels, vacant hotel units, and vacant premises in order to safeguard the health,
               safety, morals and welfare of the public. The Minimum Housing Enforcement Officer
               and enforcing officers shall be authorized to enter any vacant commercial structure,
               vacant dwelling, vacant dwelling unit, vacant rooming house, vacant rooming unit,

               duties of such office under this chapter, in accordance with the procedures herein
               prescribed. Except in emergencies endangering the public health, safety and welfare,
               the Minimum Housing Enforcement Officer and enforcing officers shall enter a vacant
               commercial structure, vacant dwelling, vacant dwelling unit, vacant rooming house,
               vacant rooming unit, vacant hotel, vacant hotel unit, or vacant premises only upon
               the prior consent of the owner, operator or the person having legal right of possession
               thereof, or in accordance with the provisions of this section. When the Minimum Housing
               Enforcement Officer or any enforcing officer has reason to believe that any vacant
               commercial structure, vacant dwelling, vacant dwelling unit, vacant rooming house,
               vacant rooming unit, vacant hotel, vacant hotel unit or vacant premises is in violation
               of the provisions of this chapter, or when such officer deems it necessary to make
               an inspection to determine whether a vacant structure or vacant premises is in violation
               of the standards established by this chapter, such officer shall request permission
               to make an inspection from the owner or operator thereof or from the person having
               the legal right of possession thereof. In the event that such person refuses to consent
               to the inspection the Minimum Housing Enforcement Officer or enforcing officer may
               apply to the County Court or Circuit Court for the issuance of an inspection warrant
               to be served by an officer duly authorized by law to serve inspection warrants and
               make arrests for violations of this chapter. The inspection warrant shall issue in
               accordance with the requirements of law, including Florida Statutes, Sections 933.20—933.30,
               and shall authorize entry into and inspection of the premises described therein. Refusal
               to permit an inspection pursuant to an inspection warrant authorized by this section
               shall constitute a violation of this chapter and shall subject the violator to the
               penalties prescribed herein.

               notice shall be in writing, shall specify the violation, and shall specify the time
               for compliance. Such notice shall specify that the violation must be corrected or

               from Team Metro or appropriate municipal Building and Zoning Department and that final

               by certified mail return receipt requested, addressed to the owner's and/or operator's
               last known address. If the owner cannot be served by certified mail, a copy of the
               notice shall be posted in a conspicuous place on the vacant structure or vacant premises
               involved. Such notice shall state the date of posting.

               the Minimum Housing Enforcement Officer shall file a copy of such final order, or

               from the owner of record of the property prior to recording the certificate of cancellation.
               Any person acquiring any interest in or to property described in a final order after
               recordation thereof shall be bound by the provisions thereof and shall take the property

               an interest in or to property for which a final order has been recorded under this
               section shall comply with the requirements thereof, and shall be subject to all of

               new owner or transferee may exercise all of the rights of appeal which would have

               and the record owner of the land or an operator of the land which is the subject of
