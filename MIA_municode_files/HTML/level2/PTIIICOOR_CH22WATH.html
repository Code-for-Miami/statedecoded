               It is hereby declared to be the policy of Miami-Dade County in the exercise of its
               police power for the public safety, health and general welfare, to eliminate and prevent
               wage theft. Eliminating the underpayment or nonpayment of wages earned by persons
               working in the County serves the public purpose by promoting economic security and
               dignity for those working in the County; by promoting business and economic development
               through the elimination of unfair economic competition by unscrupulous businesses
               that do not pay or that underpay their employees; and by relieving the burden on the
               public that subsidize unscrupulous employers whose employees are forced to rely on
               public assistance because of unpaid or underpaid wages.
