               <i>Status of Designated Properties After Transition of Jurisdiction.</i> In the event that a municipality assumes jurisdiction of historic preservation from
               Miami-Dade County by enacting an ordinance as provided in this section, all properties
               previously designated by the Miami-Dade Historic Preservation Board shall have the
               status and protections of properties designated under the municipality's historic
               preservation ordinance unless and until such designation is removed by formal action
               of the municipality pursuant to its ordinance. The same rule shall apply if the County
               assumes jurisdiction from a municipality.

               of the electors pursuant to Section 9(b) or Section 12, Article VII of the Florida

               to the property, be maintained during the period that the exemption is granted. The
               covenant or agreement shall be binding on the current property owner, transferees,
               and their heirs, successors, or assigns. Violation of the covenant or agreement results
               in the property owner being subject to the payment of the differences between the
               total amount of taxes which would have been due in March in each of the previous years
               in which the covenant or agreement was in effect had the property not received the
               exemption and the total amount of taxes actually paid in those years, plus interest
               on the difference calculated as provided in Section 212.12(3), Florida Statutes.
