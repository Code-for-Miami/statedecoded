               and/or user permit is sought in relation to explosives, the full name and address
               of the applicant, his or her physical description, his or her fingerprints, and such
               other information as may be prescribed by the Director, and shall be accompanied by
               an accurate photograph of the applicant. Such application shall be signed and sworn
               to by the applicant. The Director shall prescribe the form of applications and furnish
               such application forms to applicants upon request. County blaster and helper licenses
               are not transferable. A County user permit shall be transferable so long as the transferee
               meets all the requirements of this chapter. No County license and/or user permit shall
               be issued to any person under the age of eighteen (18) years, or who is addicted to
               the excessive use of alcohol, narcotics, drugs, stimulants, or depressants, or who,
               as a result of a physical or mental deficiency, cannot reasonably be expected to safely
               handle or utilize explosives or blasting agents, or who has been convicted of a felony.
               An applicant for a County user permit or County blaster's license must prove himself
               or herself thoroughly competent and familiar with explosives to be used and with the
               operation to be performed and with applicable regulations by an examination prepared
               and administered by the Director or his designee. The burden shall rest upon the applicant
               to establish his or her qualifications for the issuance of a County license or user
               permit. The County user permit issued hereunder shall show the purpose for which it
               is to be used, the location and the period of time for which it is valid. The County
               license issued hereunder shall show the purpose for which is to be used, and the period
