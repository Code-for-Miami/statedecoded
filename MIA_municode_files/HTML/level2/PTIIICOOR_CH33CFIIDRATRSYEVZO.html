               The Board of County Commissioners for Miami-Dade County, Florida, hereby declares
               and finds that the uncoordinated use of lands within the County threatens the orderly
               development and the health, safety, order, convenience, prosperity and welfare of
               the present and future citizens of this County. Pursuant to Ordinance No. 75-22, the
               Board adopted and accepted the Comprehensive Development Master Plan for Miami-Dade
               County whereby it specifically declared that it was the continuing policy of Miami-Dade
               County, in cooperation with federal, State, regional and local governments, and other
               concerned public and private organizations, to use all reasonable means and measures

            <p class="b0" align="left">
               The board further found that the Comprehensive Development Master Plan was enacted
               to assure for all people of Miami-Dade County an attempt to create safe, healthful,
               productive and aesthetically and culturally pleasing surroundings; to attain the widest
               range of beneficial uses of the environment without unreasonable degradation, risk
               to the health or safety, or other undesirable and unintended consequences, to preserve
               important historic, cultural and natural aspects of our national heritage; to maintain,
               wherever possible, an environment which supports diversity and variety of individual
               choice; to achieve a balance between population and resources which will permit the
               high standards of living and a wide sharing of life's amenities, and to enhance the
               quality of renewal resources and approach the maximum attainable recycling of depletable
               resources. In furtherance of these goals and objectives, the Board finds that the
               coordinated review and analysis of its mass transit facilities is necessary to carry
               on a central metropolitan government in Miami-Dade County, Florida. Coordinated review
               and analysis of the mass transit system is susceptible to, and would be most effectively
               carried on, under a uniform plan of regulation applicable to the County as a whole.
               The planning of major transportation facilities, combined with other plan implementation
               tools, can be effectively used in meeting social, economic and environmental needs
               and in creating a major influence on metropolitan development patterns and life styles.
               The capability of a transportation network, acting in conjunction with other urban
               services to establish general development trends, is well recognized. A maximum coordination
               of transportation and land use policy decisions is therefore essential to optimize
               the role of transportation as a potent tool for implementing the desired patterns
               of metropolitan development.

            <p class="p0" align="left">
               The Board further finds that the Stage I Fixed-Guideway Rapid Transit System has,
               since 1973, undergone extensive planning, review, analysis, and engineering design
               efforts. The Stage I System has received design approval from both the federal and
               State governments and is in the process of final design, procurement and construction
               activities. The Stage I System, including proposed improvements in other forms of
               surface transportation facilities, represents a concerted, coordinated effort to improve
               not only the transportation facilities within Miami-Dade County, but the overall quality
               of life enjoyed by citizens of and visitors to Miami-Dade County. Finally, the Stage
               I System represents one (1) of the largest public works projects ever undertaken in
               Miami-Dade County and the Southeastern United States. As such, the Stage I Fixed-Guideway
               Rapid Transit System may only be planned, engineered, implemented, and administered
               on a County-wide basis, in a manner which will:
