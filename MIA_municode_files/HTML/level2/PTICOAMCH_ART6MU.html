               shall complete a budgetary analysis in cooperation with the Incorporation Committee
               of and on the proposed incorporation area and schedule at least one public hearing

               by the incorporation committee if submitted, shall be provided to the resident electors
               of the proposed municipality by mail and shall be made available at locations within
               the proposed municipality. The proposed municipal charter shall be made available
               at locations within the proposed municipality and made available electronically. Such
               budgetary analysis shall at a minimum estimate all of the identifiable revenues generated
               by the proposed incorporation area prior to incorporation, and present the operating
               expenses of comparable small, medium and large municipalities providing typical municipal
               services.

               include any area outside the urban development boundary, as may be described in the
               County's Comprehensive Development Master Plan, shall abide by the permitted uses
               as set forth in such plan. It is further provided, as a condition of incorporation,
               that the new municipality shall provide in its charter: to remain a part of the Miami-Dade
               Fire Rescue District, to remain a part of the Miami-Dade Library System, to contract
               with Miami-Dade County for local patrol police services for a minimum of three years,
               for Miami-Dade County to retain authority for residential garbage and refuse collection
               and disposal within the proposed new municipality, and for the payment, assumption,
               or other satisfaction for that portion of the County's preexisting debts and obligations
               or other refundings secured by revenues or taxes collected within the proposed municipality's
               area and that neither the new municipality nor its electors shall take any action
               that would adversely affect the County's bond or other debt obligations that are secured
               by taxes or revenues from the area constituting the new municipality.
