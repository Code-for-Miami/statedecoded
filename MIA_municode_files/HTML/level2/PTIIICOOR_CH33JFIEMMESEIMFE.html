            <p class="content1">The provision of adequate fire and emergency medical service facilities is essential
               for the health, safety, and welfare of the public. The existing level of service (LOS)
               in Miami-Dade County provides for the prompt dispatch of fire and rescue task force
               of a size and composition appropriate to the land use occupancy type requiring the
               service, resulting in an approximate average response time within the district of
               six (6) minutes for the first arriving unit.

               the fire service network will have to be expanded.

               the construction of fire rescue stations and the acquisition of capital equipment
               required to accommodate the impact of the new development.

               from development occurring in one zone shall be expended to mitigate the impacts and
               to benefit the development occurring in that zone. Additionally, to the extent that
               new development in one zone impacts and receives benefit from any capital expansions
               and acquisitions in an adjacent zone due to alarm responses and dispatches in accordance
               with Miami-Dade Fire Rescue Department policy, funds from that zone may be expended
               up to six (6) miles in the adjacent zone. Further, funds shall be expended from each
               zone for growth-necessitated capital acquisitions and expansions to central response
               and support services to the extent that increased development within that zone produces
               impacts on and receives benefits from central response and support services.
