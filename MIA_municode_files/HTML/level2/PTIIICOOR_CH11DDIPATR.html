               The Board finds that the palm blight disease known as lethal yellowing has reached
               epidemic proportions within Dade County, that the disease is a highly infectious one
               and that those trees which are infected with lethal yellowing to the point that they
               are beyond treatment should be quickly removed so as to reduce spreading of the disease.

               infected with lethal yellowing or that their infection has not progressed to the point
               that said trees are beyond treatment. At the hearing the County or the property owner
               may introduce such evidence as is deemed necessary. The County Manager or an assistant
               designated by him shall hold hearings at appropriate times and places, and the County
               Manager shall establish rules and regulations for the review procedure. Following

               If within twenty (20) days after mailing of the notice no hearing has been requested
               and the trees described in the notice have not been removed, the Director of the Park
               and Recreation Department shall have the trees removed by Dade County at the expense
               of the property owner. If a hearing has been held and has concluded adversely to the

               and charge will be made upon the property, which shall be payable with interest at
               the rate of six (6) percent per annum from the date of such certification until paid.

               such payment the Clerk of the Circuit Court shall, by appropriate means, evidence
               the satisfaction and cancellation of such lien upon the record thereof and notify
               the Tax Collector of such satisfaction. Notice of such lien shall be filed in the

               Any party aggrieved by the administrative decision may have such decision reviewed
               by the filing of a petition for writ of certiorari in the Circuit Court of the Eleventh
               Judicial Circuit in and for Dade County, Florida, for a review of the record upon
               which the decision is based, in accordance with the procedure and within the time
               provided by the Florida Appellate Rules for the review of the rulings of any commission
               or Board, which rules of practice and procedure are hereby adopted. For such purposes,
               the County Manager shall make available for public inspection and copying the record
               of each such decision to be reviewed; provided, the Manager may make a reasonable
               charge commensurate with the cost, in the event he is able to and does furnish copies
               of all or any portion of the record at the hearing. Prior to certifying a copy of
               any record or portion thereof, the Manager or his designee shall make all necessary
               corrections in order that the copy is a true and correct copy of the record, or those
               portions thereof requested, and shall make a charge of not more than twenty-five cents
               ($0.25) per page, instrument or exhibit; provided the charges here authorized are
               not intended to repeal or amend any fee or schedule of fees otherwise established.
