               impact fee manual and, if appropriate, make recommendations to the Board of County
               Commissioners for revisions to the chapter and the police services impact fee manual.
               The purpose of this review is to ensure that the benefits to a feepaying development
               are equitable in that the fee charged to the paying development shall not exceed a
               proportionate fair share of the costs of mitigating police service impacts of new
               developments, and that the procedures for administering the impact fee remain efficient.
               Additionally, within one hundred twenty (120) days from the date of the end of the
               fiscal year, the Office of Capital Improvements shall submit to the County Manager
               a financial and management report on the impact fee trust funds. No later than thirty
               (30) days after submission of the report, the County Manager shall conduct a public
               meeting, for the purpose of presenting the report and receiving public comment on
               the report as well as the impact fee program. This meeting shall be advertised at
               least seven (7) days in advance in a newspaper of general circulation. No later than
               thirty (30) days after the public meeting, the County Manager shall schedule the report,
               which shall serve as the County's Annual Impact Fee Report, for the Board of County
               Commissioners' consideration. The County Manager shall provide a companion report
               to the Board advising of any County Manager recommended impact fee program changes
               and detailing comments received from the annual impact fee public meeting.
