               Through September 30, 2020, a company wishing to participate in the TJIF Program will
               submit an application to The Beacon Council. Upon request, a Company's confidentiality
               will be protected for any information regarding a project's location and/or expansion
               evaluation of any site in Florida in accordance with Sections 288.075 and 288.1066

               The application will be approved by the Board of County Commissioners and all TJIF

               At the time of application, The Beacon Council will confirm that the Company has provided
               information and/or documentation supporting the Company's consideration of other locations
               and that the requested TJIF incentive is required for the Company to choose Miami-Dade
               County as the location of its new operations or expansion. Any Company decisions committing
               the Company to a location in the County prior to the Board of County Commissioners
               approval of the TJIF application/agreement will render a Company ineligible to participate
               in the TJIF program. The County Mayor or the County Mayor's designee may waive this
               prior decision rule and forward the Company's application to the Board of County Commissioners
               for consideration upon the written request by the Company to preserve the inducement
               for a limited time period and the recommendation of The Beacon Council. However, the
               Board of County Commissioners retains the sole and absolute discretion to approve
               or deny the Company's application. This prior business decision rule waiver shall
               not be available to a Company that has already publicly disclosed the intent to locate
               or expand its operations in Miami-Dade County. Upon receipt and initial review, The
               Beacon Council shall contact the County to schedule application presentation to County
               staff as directed by the County Mayor or the County Mayor's designee. Within 14 days
               of receipt of the Company's application, The Beacon Council shall prepare its recommendation
               on the application, including an economic impact analysis utilizing a professionally
               accepted econometric model such as Department of Commerce, BEA RIMS-II; Minnesota
               Implan Group, IMPLAN V.3; or REMI, Inc., REMI Model PI+. At the request of The Beacon
               Council or at the direction of the County Mayor or the County Mayor's designee, the
               analysis and projections of economic and fiscal impacts may be performed by the Office
               of Economic Development and International Trade, or its successor department, using

               Annual disbursements will be contingent on the verification of the new jobs created,

               fiscal year following the Project's Capital Investment appearing on the tax roll.

               fiscal year that begins on October 1 following the May 15 claims-submission date.
               The claim for award must include a copy of all documents that allow the County to
