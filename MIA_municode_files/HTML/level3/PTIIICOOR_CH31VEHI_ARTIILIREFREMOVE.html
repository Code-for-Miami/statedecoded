               which causes the price of regular unleaded gasoline to increase by 50 cents from the

               in effect as of the most recent taximeter rate adjustment. Upon reaching the first

               the initial surcharge, each additional increase of 50 cents of regular unleaded gasoline
               may trigger an increase in the dollar value of the surcharge by 50 cents. The average
               weekly price of regular unleaded gasoline must remain at or above a level, as described
               above, for three (3) consecutive weeks before a surcharge, or an increase in the surcharge,
               may be authorized by the Director. The fuel surcharge shall expire upon the effective

               by the Director, should the average weekly price of regular unleaded gasoline remain
               at or below a level, as stated above, for three (3) consecutive weeks. The average

               regular unleaded gasoline by the United States Department of Energy, Energy Information
               Administration. The surcharge may be added to the taximeter rate or flat fare rate
               and, if added, shall be reflected on the taximeter as an extra charge on vehicles
               so equipped. Notice of a surcharge approved pursuant to this section must be prominently

               Ch. 31, Art. II, §§ 31-81—31-93, was amended in its entirety by Ord. No. 81-85, § 3, adopted July 21, 1981.
               Prior to the enactment of said 81-85, Art. II had derived from Ord. No. 79-25, adopted
               March 20, 1979, which ordinance was held invalid. Section 2 of Ord. No. 81-85 reconfirmed
               the repeal (by Ord. No. 79-25) of earlier Ord. Nos. 75-35, 75-111, 77-42, 78-61—78-86,
               from which Art. II had derived prior to the passage of Ord. No. 79-25. Ord. No. 81-85,
               § 2, also repealed Ord. Nos. 79-60, 79-77, 79-116, 80-17, 80-74, 80-85 and 80-96,
               which were not codified.
