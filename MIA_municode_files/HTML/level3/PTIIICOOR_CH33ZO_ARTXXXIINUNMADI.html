               setting forth a full description of the proposed use or occupancy, and accurate legal
               description of the property or premises, a description of the structure or structures
               to be constructed or occupied, satisfactory proof that the proposed use will conform
               to the requirements of the Miami-Dade County Pollution Control Ordinance, and such
               other information as may be reasonably required by the Director, who shall determine
               from such information, whether or not the proposed use will, in fact, create objectionable
               influences ordinarily associated with the general type of such uses. If it is found
               that such use because of the method of operation, or type of materials used, the usual
               degree of hazardous conditions will not be created, the Director may assign the use
               to the IU-3 District or to a less restrictive zoning district. However, if it is determined
               that the high hazards usually anticipated in connection with the uses listed involving
               fire, explosions, noise, vibration, dust or emissions of smoke, odors, or toxic gases,
               or other hazards to public health, safety or welfare will be created, the Director
               shall require approval as result of a public hearing before such use is permitted.
               Upon filing of the application, the Director shall transmit such application, together
               with his recommendations, to the Community Zoning Appeals Board, who shall consider
               the application in accordance with the zoning procedure prescribed by article XXXVI
               of this chapter, and transmit its recommendations to the County Commission. Provided,
               however, no use specified in<a href="../level3/PTIIICOOR_CH33ZO_ARTXXXIINUNMADI.html#PTIIICOOR_CH33ZO_ARTXXXIINUNMADI_S33-264USPE"> Section 33-264</a>(3) shall be established within five hundred (500) feet of any RU or EU District except
               after approval after public hearing. Provided, that the spacing limitation shall be
               two hundred fifty (250) feet if the use is confined within a building and an exterior
               wall or walls of the building located on the establishment is not penetrated with
               any openings directly facing the RU or EU District. It is further provided that, except
               for exterior uses, such distances shall be measured from the closest point of the
               subject use in the building to the RU or EU District. In connection with exterior
               uses, the distance of five hundred (500) feet shall be measured from the closest point
               of the IU District to the RU or EU District. For purposes of establishing such distances,
               the applicant for such use shall furnish a certified survey from a registered surveyor,
