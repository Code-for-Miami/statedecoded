               Subsequently, an administrative order of Feb. 16, 1988, separated a new department
               from the Housing and Urban Development Department. Said administrative order provided
               as follows: "This administrative order creates the new Department of Special Housing
               Programs and supersedes all previous administrative orders concerning the functions
               included in this Department. The Department of Special Housing Programs shall be responsible
               for the administration of such Federal, State and local housing programs as: Residential
               and Multifamily Rehabilitation Assistance, Urban Homesteading, and Rental Rehabilitation;
               the Section 8 programs (Existing, Moderate Rehabilitation, Substantial and New Construction);

               programs (Lottery, Community Development Corporation, Rental Housing, and the Developer
