                  81-57, adopted May 19, 1981, the County enacted water shortage emergency procedures
                  to take effect upon declaration of an emergency by the South Florida Water Management
                  District as long as such emergency exists. Section 3 of Ord. No. 85-25 repealed both
                  Ord. No. 81-54 and Ord. No. 81-57.
