               The purpose and intent of the Planned Area Development District, is to create living
               environments that are responsive to the needs of their inhabitants; to provide flexibility
               in planning, design and development; to encourage innovative approaches to the design
               of community environments; to encourage the fulfillment of housing needs appropriate
               to various life styles and income levels; to encourage the integration of different
               housing types within a development; to provide for necessary commercial, recreational
               and educational facilities conveniently located in relation to housing; to provide
               for an efficient use of land; to provide an environment compatible with surrounding
               land use; to adapt the zoning process to changes in construction and development technology;
               to encourage the preservation of the natural site features; to provide community environments
               that are so designed and located as to be an integral part of the total ecosystem;
               to encourage the design of communities and structures adapted to the local subtropical
               climate; thereby promoting the public health, safety, and general welfare of Miami-Dade
               County.
