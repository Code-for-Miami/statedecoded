               It is the intent of the Board of County Commissioners to create an affordable housing
               trust fund as a permanent, renewable source of revenue to meet, in part, the housing
               needs of the residents of Miami-Dade County. Those households which are intended to
               benefit from the trust fund shall be income eligible and possess at least one of the
               following characteristics: (1) they are cost-burdened by paying more than 30% of their
               gross income for housing costs, (2) they live in overcrowded conditions, or (3) they
               live in substandard housing units.
               
               
            </p>
            <p class="p0" align="left">
               The affordable housing trust fund shall be used solely for programs and administrative
               support approved by the Board of County Commissioners to meet the housing needs of
               those households who meet the target income of up to 140% of the area median income
               for Miami-Dade County. These programs shall include, without limitation, those providing
               assistance through production, acquisition, rehabilitation and preservation of housing
               units.
               
               
            </p>
            <p class="p0" align="left">
               All appropriated funds designated by the Board of County Commissioners shall be deposited
               into the affordable housing trust fund in an interest-bearing account. All interest
               earnings from the account shall be reinvested and dedicated to the trust fund. All
               appropriated funds in the affordable housing trust fund account shall be available
               for program expenditures.
               
               
            </p>
            <p class="p0" align="left">
               The objective of creating an affordable housing trust fund is to foster a housing
               supply accessible to a range of family incomes in developments assisted by the trust
               fund and to disperse affordable housing units throughout the County, in accordance
               with objectives, goals, and policies of the housing element of the CDMP.

               than four people, than the base income eligibility determined as provided in subsection
