               It is the purpose and intent of the Board of County Commissioners, in enacting this
               article under and pursuant to the provisions of Section 4.08 of the Home Rule Charter,
               to create and establish an Advisory Board of official status composed of outstanding
               citizens with representative interests and geographical distribution, who are dedicated
               to the purposes of providing a feasible, adequate Public Library system for this entire
               metropolitan area in cooperation with all other governmental entities, and that will
               be in a position to furnish information, advice and counsel to the Board of County
               Commissioners in respect to the appropriate means and methods by which adequate Public
               Library facilities and services may be provided within the framework of the County
               government on a sound financial basis for the use and benefit of all residents and
               visitors of this metropolitan area, and to work towards the development and implementation
               of sound programs for public libraries through the mutual cooperation between the
               State, County and municipal governments and agencies and coordination with non-governmental
               organizations interested in library facilities and services. This article shall not
               be construed as delegating to such advisory board or its members any power or authority
               of a governmental, legislative or administrative nature, but as the establishment
               of an official instrumentality by which the Board of County Commissioners may obtain
               the benefit of accurate, comprehensive information, advice and counsel concerning
               all matters relating to public libraries and other cultural facilities and programs
               which may be necessary for appropriate action by the Board of County Commissioners.

               This article is derived from Ord. No. 63-27, adopted on July 2, 1963. Section 10 of
               said ordinance declared it to be the intention of the County Commission that the provisions
               of the ordinance, including the recitations contained in the "whereas" clauses, become
               a part of this Code of Ordinances. The "whereas" clauses read as follows:
               <a href="#ref.fn_42">(Back)</a></p>
            
            <p class="refgenericFN">
                "WHEREAS, it is recognized that the establishment, maintenance and administration
               of adequate Public Library facilities to which the general public has free access
               as places of resort to seek quiet study, educational pursuits and enjoyment constitute
               joint functions and responsibilities of the State, County and municipal government;

                "WHEREAS, it is apparent that increased and expanded Public Library facilities and
               services, and the coordination of existing Public Library facilities and services,
               are urgently required in order to meet the needs of the ever increasing population
               of this metropolitan area. This may be accomplished only by appropriate planning based

               Library system for the use and benefit of all the residents and visitors of this metropolitan
               area constitutes a governmental function or service that is susceptible to, and may

               Commissioners of the several counties the permissive power to establish, operate and
               maintain free public libraries, and prescribe the methods and procedures by which
               such power shall be exercised. The general laws further authorize certain types of
               grants of financial assistance to counties meeting regulations established by the
               State Library Board. The general laws also grant to the governing bodies of municipalities
               the power and authority to establish, maintain and operate public libraries in accordance
               with the prescribed statutory procedures. The Home Rule Charter of Government for
               Miami-Dade County, Florida, empowers the Board of County Commissioners to provide
               libraries and other cultural facilities and programs, to create by ordinance such
               Boards as may be deemed necessary, and to carry on a central metropolitan government

               and the appropriate planning for additional facilities and services, relating to public
               libraries, may be best accomplished through the medium of an advisory Board composed
