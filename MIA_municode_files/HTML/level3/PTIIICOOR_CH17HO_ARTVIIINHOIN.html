               This article shall be entitled, "The Infill Housing Initiative." Its purpose is to
               increase the availability of affordable homes for low and moderate income persons,
               maintain a stock of affordable housing, redevelop urban neighborhoods by eliminating
               the blight of vacant lots and dilapidated or abandoned properties, to equitably distribute
               homeownership opportunities within the Infill Target Areas, and generate payment of
               ad valorem taxes. The Infill Housing Initiative shall encourage the redevelopment
               of vacant, dilapidated or abandoned property through the sale or transfer of County
               property to qualified developers and the inclusion of privately owned vacant, dilapidated
               or abandoned properties. The community development corporations and developers shall
               be required to build affordable single-family homes to be sold to low and moderate
               income households. Although the Infill Housing Initiative is primarily designed to
               create affordable homeownership of single-family homes, the County under limited circumstances
               may at its sole discretion permit developers to rent these homes to qualified low
               or moderate income families.
