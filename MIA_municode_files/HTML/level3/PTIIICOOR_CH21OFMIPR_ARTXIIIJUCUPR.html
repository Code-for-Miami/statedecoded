            <p class="content1">This commission hereby finds and determines as a matter of fact that Miami-Dade County
               is facing a mounting crisis caused by increasing crime, including juvenile crime and
               delinquency which threatens peaceful citizens, residents, and visitors. This commission
               further determines that this criminal activity, both individually and collectively,
               presents a clear and present danger to the citizenry and to the public order and safety.
               The economic cost of crime in Miami-Dade County continues to drain existing resources.
               Additionally, the effect on victims, both economic and psychological, is traumatic
               and tragic.

            <p class="incr0">(b)</p>
            		
            <p class="content1">This commission finds that fighting crime effectively requires a multipronged effort,
               with one (1) aspect focusing on those age groups particularly vulnerable to and injured
               by crime, and susceptible to being induced into committing crime. Consequently, it
               is the intent of the Commission to create and implement a juvenile curfew program
               aimed at protecting juveniles from crime and reducing juvenile crime and the direct
               and indirect consequences thereof.

            <p class="content1">Juveniles in Miami-Dade County have themselves become victims of crime and violence
               in steadily increasing numbers. Violent crimes against juveniles in Miami-Dade County
               are dramatically high in number, and the psychological effect of crime committed upon
               juveniles is particularly tragic and traumatic. A juvenile curfew program would have
               the additional benefit of reducing juvenile victimization.
