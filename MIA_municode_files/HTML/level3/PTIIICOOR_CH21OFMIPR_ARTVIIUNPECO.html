            <p class="content1">The court of appropriate jurisdiction, where the defendant has been found guilty or
               has entered a plea of guilty or a plea of nolo contendere, may at a time to be determined
               by the court, either with or without an adjudication of the guilt of the defendant,
               hear and determine the question of the probation of such defendant.

            <p class="content1">Prior to such hearing the court may refer the case to the Probation and Parole Commission
               for investigation and recommendation. The court, upon such reference, shall direct
               the commission to make an investigation and report in writing at a specified time
               to the court upon the circumstances of the offense, the criminal record, the social
               history, and the present condition of the defendant together with its recommendation.

            <p class="content1">If it appears to the court upon a hearing of the matter that the defendant is not
               likely again to engage in an unlawful course of conduct and that the ends of justice
               and the welfare of society do not require that the defendant shall presently suffer
               the penalty imposed by law, the court, in its discretion, may either adjudge the defendant
               to be guilty or stay and withhold the adjudication of guilt and in either case stay
               and withhold the imposition of sentence upon such defendant, and shall place him upon
               probation under the supervision and control of the Probation and Parole Commission
               for the duration of such probation. And the said Commission shall thereupon and thereafter,
               during the continuance of such probation, have the supervision and control of the
               defendant.

            <p class="content1">Whenever punishment by imprisonment in the County Jail is prescribed, the court, in
               its discretion, may at the time of sentencing direct the defendant to be placed on
               probation upon completion of any specified period of such sentence. In such case,
               the court shall stay and withhold the imposition of the remainder of sentence imposed
               upon the defendant, and direct that the defendant be placed upon probation after serving
               such period as may be imposed by the court.

            <p class="incr0">(5)</p>
            		
            <p class="content1">In no case shall the imposition of sentence be suspended and the defendant thereupon
               placed on probation unless such defendant be placed under the custody of said Probation
               and Parole Commission.

            <p class="refeditorFN"><b>Editor's note—</b>
               Article VII, §§ 21-80—21-137, derived from Ord. No. 65-1, adopted January 12, 1965, as amended by Ord.
               No. 65-31, adopted April 20, 1965, was repealed by Ord. No. 65-57, § 1, enacted September
               14, effective September 24, 1965. Article VII was previously designated "Miami-Dade
               County Penal Code," however, it was never officially in effect, as the original ordinance,
               Ord. No. 65-1, was not to become effective until May 1, 1965, and prior to that time
               Ord. No. 65-31 postponed the effective date to October 1, 1965. Article VII, §§ 21-80—21-87 is now derived from Ord. No. 70-15, §§ 1—8, enacted Feb. 25, 1970, and was
               codified in this manner at the discretion of the editors, pursuant to authority in
               § 10 of this ordinance.
