               It is the intent of the County to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare
               by providing for the control of cable systems in incorporated and unincorporated Miami-Dade
               County; to provide for the payment of fees and other valuable consideration by a licensee

               operating a cable system; to promote widespread availability of cable service to County
               residents; to encourage the provision of diverse information to the community over

                  bulk-rate contract is counted as twenty (20) subscriptions (i.e., 1,000 ° 50 = 20).

               No license, including a renewal license, shall be issued for a term longer than ten

               renewal simultaneously. Notwithstanding, a license may be extended for a period of

               to the required telephone standards.

               (e) In the event of a service interruption to any subscriber for twenty-four (24)
               or more hours which interruption is within the control of the licensee, the licensee
               shall provide a credit or rebate to affected subscribers, upon the subscriber's written
               or verbal request, equal to twenty (20) percent of the monthly fees for each twenty-four-hour
               period during which the subscriber's service is interrupted. In the event of a service
               interruption to any subscriber for two (2) or more hours, the licensee shall provide
               a credit or rebate to affected subscribers, upon the subscriber's written or verbal
               request, equal to one-thirtieth of the monthly bill. For purposes of computing the
               time of interrupted service, the time shall begin when a complaint for interrupted
               service is received by the licensee or when the licensee has actual or constructive
               notice of the interruption, whichever occurs first. Nothing in this subsection limits
               the licensee from applying a rebate policy more liberal than the requirements. As
               used in this Section, service interruption shall mean the loss of picture or sound
               on one or more cable channels.

               subscribers for a time period greater than four (4) hours, the licensee shall notify
               the Director or his designee immediately.

               (h) A licensee shall disconnect any subscriber who so requests from the cable system
               of the licensee. No period of notice prior to voluntary termination of service may
               be required of subscribers by any license. No charge may be imposed by any licensee
               for such voluntary disconnection, or for any cable services delivered after the date
               of disconnect request. A subscriber may be asked to disconnect the equipment of the
               licensee and return it to the business office or make it available for the licensee
               to recover. Upon termination of service to any subscriber, the licensee shall promptly
               remove all portions of its system, facilities and equipment from the subscriber's
               premises upon request. Where removal is impractical, such as with buried cable or
               internal wiring, facilities and equipment may be disconnected rather than removed.
