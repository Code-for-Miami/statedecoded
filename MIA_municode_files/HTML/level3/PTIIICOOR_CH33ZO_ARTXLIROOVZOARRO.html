            <p class="p0" align="left">
               <i>Asphalt plant</i> shall mean a facility used for the manufacture of asphalt paving products by combining
               crushed limestone, sand or screening with a heated petroleum binder in a kiln. An
               asphalt plant includes parking spaces needed for trucks, materials handling equipment,
               and administrative, control and office buildings. The asphalt manufactured at an asphalt
               plant consists of more than 80% limestone quarry products, which asphalt is primarily
               used in highway and parking area paving.
               
               
            </p>
            <p class="p0" align="left">
               <i>Cement plant</i> shall mean a facility used for the manufacture of cement and mortar products. The
               products are manufactured by grinding limestone to a fine consistency and mixing it
               with certain additives such as silicates, aluminates, and iron oxides and then heating
               it in kilns to temperatures in excess of 2000Â° Fahrenheit. This process produces clinker,
               which is ground by mills with other ingredients such as gypsum to make specific types
               of cement and mortar products used in concrete manufacturing and masonry/brick construction.
               A cement plant includes parking spaces needed for trucks, materials handling equipment,
               and administrative, control and office buildings. The cement manufactured at a cement
               plant consists of more than 90% limestone quarry products.

            <p class="p0" align="left">
               <i>Concrete batching plant or ready mixed concrete plant</i> shall mean a facility used for the delivery of limestone aggregate, sand or screenings,
               cement and water into mixer trucks as part of the concrete manufacturing process.
               This facility may contain a system of conveyor belts, chutes, storage silos, stockpile
               areas, water and air systems, and weight scales and meters for the accurate dispensing
               of the raw materials to produce the desired strength and type of concrete. A concrete
               batching plant or ready mixed concrete plant facility includes parking spaces needed
               for trucks, materials handling equipment, and administrative, control and office buildings.
               The concrete manufactured at a concrete batching plant or ready mixed concrete plant
               consists of more than 90% limestone quarry products.
               
               
            </p>
            <p class="p0" align="left">
               <i>Concrete block plant</i> shall mean a facility used for the manufacture of concrete block and contains sufficient
               ground and/or covered storage for curing the blocks once removed from their molds,
               as well as materials batching equipment with automated systems for placing the concrete
               into block molds and transporting the blocks to curing racks and stockpile areas.
               A concrete block plant includes parking spaces needed for trucks, materials handling
               equipment, and administrative, control or office buildings. The concrete blocks manufactured
               at a concrete block plant consist of more than 90% limestone quarry products.
               
               
            </p>
            <p class="p0" align="left">
               <i>DERM</i> shall mean the Miami-Dade County Department of Environmental Resources Management.

               <i>Prestressed and precast concrete production plant</i> shall mean a facility used for the manufacture of various concrete products and includes
               the equipment necessary to deliver concrete into molds and the materials needed to
               add strength to the final product such as steel reinforcement bars, strands or mesh,
               or, in the case of prestressed concrete, wire strands in tension. A prestressed and
               precast concrete production plant manufactures such things as concrete pipe, vaults,
               and bridge and highway components, requires a large outside storage area for finished
               product inventory, and includes parking spaces needed for trucks, materials handling
               equipment, and administrative, control and office buildings. The products produced
               at a prestressed and precast concrete production plant consist of more than 95% limestone
               quarry products, excluding the steel reinforcement material.
