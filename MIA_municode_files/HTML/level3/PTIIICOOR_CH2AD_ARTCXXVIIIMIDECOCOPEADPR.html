               to the poor, elderly and disadvantaged citizens who cannot afford to buy a mainstream
               newspaper.

               It is the intention of Miami-Dade County to publish advertising in the periodicals
               that qualify and become a part of this program. No rights to receive advertising contracts
               are granted by qualifying for or participating in this program. The decision of whether,
               what, and how much to publish in a particular periodical remains in the sole discretion
               of Miami-Dade County, which may consider any lawful factor in making its decision
               including, but not limited to, rates, target audience, frequency and consistency of
               publication, while advertising rates shall remain the sole discretion of the individual
               periodical operating in a free market economy. The exercise of the County's discretion
               in this regard shall not be subject to any appeal. Nothing herein shall restrict the
               ability of an individual periodical to adopt whatever rate it deems appropriate, provided
               that Miami-Dade County may decline to purchase advertising based upon the rate. The
               Department charged with administering this program may periodically issue its own
               rate ceiling cards indicating the maximum amounts that it will pay for various categories
               of advertising.

               Community Periodical Advertising Expenditure. Each Department or County Entity that

               County to do business within the County. As used in this section "discretionary print

               to be published by ordinance, statute or law as a precondition to a County action

               total budgeted print advertising dollars, the discretionary print advertising dollars,
               the print advertising dollars that are legally required to be published in newspapers
               of general circulation, and the non-print advertising dollars. If a specific amount
               for the program is established in the budget ordinance, the specific amount so established
               will control and the above provisions will not apply. Unless the budget ordinance
               indicates otherwise, moneys allocated in the budget for the program will be spent
               on the purchase of advertising and not on administrative expenses such as audits.
