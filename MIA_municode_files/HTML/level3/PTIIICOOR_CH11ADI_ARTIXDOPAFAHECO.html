            <p class="content1">The Miami-Dade County Board of County Commissioners finds that a significant number
               of Miami-Dade residents establish and maintain important personal, emotional, and
               economic relationships with persons to whom they are not married. Individuals forming
               such domestic partnerships often live in a committed family relationship. Domestic
               partners may be denied the right to visit each other or their children or parents
               when hospitalized or incarcerated for lack of a system that establishes rights of
               visitation in such circumstances. Also, partners in domestic relationships may be
               denied public and private sector benefits because there is no established system for
               such relationships to be registered or recognized. In addition, because of the status
               of their relationship, domestic partners in many cases are not extended certain employment
               benefits that are otherwise made available to other employees.

               three million (3,000,000) Americans identified themselves as living in a domestic
               partnership. As a result, employers have begun to provide domestic partner benefits
               in greater numbers.

            <p class="content1">The Miami-Dade County Board of County Commissioners finds that the provision of domestic
               partner benefits promotes employee recruitment, employee retention, and employee loyalty.
               Furthermore, the provision of such benefits promotes fairness and serves to address
               the discriminatory effect of practices which deny such benefits solely upon the basis
               of an employee's familial or marital status.
