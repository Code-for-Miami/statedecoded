            <p class="content1">The Director of the Miami-Dade Water and Sewer Department is hereby given discretion
               to provide a one-time lifetime billing adjustment to a customer who disputes a high
               bill that is not the result of a concealed or visible leak. The Director's discretion
               to grant such a credit will be based on his assessment that there are extreme circumstances
               affecting the customer's account that merit a credit. If awarded, similar to the credit
               provided in the Department's Rules 2.10(1)(e) and 3.10(1)(e), such credit will be
               a 50 percent credit to the water portion of the customer's high bill above the customer's
               last yearly average consumption and a 100 percent credit to the sewer portion of the
               customer's high bill above the customer's last yearly average consumption.

               situations in which a customer receives a bill that exceeds six (6) times the past
               year's average, as applicable, monthly or quarterly consumption but is unable to show
               the Department that the high bill is due to a leak, concealed or visible, and cannot
               otherwise explain the high water bill.

               collection during the previous 12 months.

               with a notarized affidavit stating that a licensed plumber has checked the residence
               (inside and out) for leaks (both concealed and visible); that the customer did not
               leave a hose running inadvertently or otherwise allow water to flow for any period
               of time; and that there have been no changes in water usage within the household during
               the billing period (i.e., new landscaping, guests visiting, major household repairs
               or construction that required increased water usage, problems with one's pool or sprinkler
               system, or water theft). Additionally, the customer's licensed plumber must also execute
               the notarized affidavit before the customer submits it to the Department for consideration
               for a one-time lifetime adjustment.

               direct or indirect ownership interest in another entity. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
