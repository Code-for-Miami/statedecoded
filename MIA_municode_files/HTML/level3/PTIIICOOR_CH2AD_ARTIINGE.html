               of the County Commission. The Mayor or Mayor's designee shall review all construction
               projects to determine whether the break-up of the project into smaller contracts will
               increase the opportunity for CSBEs to participate therein. For those contracts where

               <i>Legislative findings and purpose.</i> The County Commission recognizes that substance abuse is a complex societal problem
               that continues to threaten the welfare of our residents and community as a whole.
               The Commission considers substance abuse on the job to be an unsafe and counterproductive
               work practice. A substance abusing employee is absent from the workplace four (4)
               to five (5) times more often, has three (3) times more accidents and four (4) times
               more hospitalization costs than a nonabusing employee. Consistent with its policy
               to promote a safe work environment and encourage personal health for all Miami-Dade
               Countians, the Commission finds it necessary to combat substance abuse in the workplace
               by promoting education and awareness. Consistent with the Drug Free Workplace Act
               of 1988 and with the drug-free workplace requirements applicable to workplaces of
               County employees, the County Commission wishes to adopt the following drug-free workplace
               requirements for persons and entities contracting or conducting business transactions
               with any agency or instrumentality of Miami-Dade County, including the Public Health
               Trust. The ultimate goal of this policy is to balance the respect for individual privacy
               with the need to keep a safe, productive, and drug-free workplace.

               <i>Proceeding before Ethics Commission.</i> A finding by the Ethics Commission that a person has violated this section shall
               subject said person to an admonition or public reprimand and/or a fine of five hundred
               dollars ($500.00) for the first such violation and one thousand dollars ($1,000.00)

               person shall be subject to a fine of one thousand dollars ($1.000.00) for the first
               such violation and two thousand dollars ($2,000.00) for each subsequent violation.
               Actual costs incurred by the Ethics Commission, in an amount not to exceed five hundred
               dollars ($500.00) per violation, may be assessed where the Ethics Commission has found
               an intentional violation of this section. The Ethics Commission may also order the
               person to pay restitution when the person or a third party has received a pecuniary
               benefit as a result of the person's violation. The procedure for determining restitution
               shall be governed by an administrative order adopted by the County Commission and
               rules of procedure promulgated by the Ethics Commission.

               which shall be offered to the Parks and Recreation Department hereunder at no cost

               organizations by sale or donation pursuant to this section predominantly shall be
               used by such organization in Miami-Dade County. The offer shall disclose the value,
               condition, and intended use of the surplus property. Prior to the County Commission
               approving a sale, donation or other disposition of surplus property to a community
               based organization, the organization shall specify to the County the intended use

               of the County. Agreements between the County and a community based organization shall

               such failure was limited to isolated instances and was not pervasive, the County Manager

               equal to the amount of such underpayment be withheld from the contractor and remitted
               to the employee, and may also fine the contractor or subcontractor for such noncompliance
               as follows: for the first underpayment, a penalty in an amount equal to 10% of the
               amount thereof; for the second underpayment, a penalty in an amount equal to 20% thereof;
               for the third and successive underpayments, a penalty in an amount equal to 30% thereof.
               A fourth violation, shall constitute a default of the subject contract and may be
               cause for suspension or termination in accordance with the contract's terms and debarment
               in accordance with the debarment procedures of the County. Monies received from payment
