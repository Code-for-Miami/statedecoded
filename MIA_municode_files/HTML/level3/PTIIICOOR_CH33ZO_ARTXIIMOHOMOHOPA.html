               It is the purpose and intent of this article to provide regulations to control the
               use of mobile homes and to establish standards for mobile home parks which will promote
               the placement of parks in appropriate locations where there exist or would be provided
               the basic amenities and services akin to those in low- and medium-density areas, and
               to provide for the grouping of these mobile home units to make an efficient aesthetically
               pleasing use of land within the mobile home community so that a high-quality residential
               area will be created and maintained for the benefit of the mobile home community and
               adjacent properties and the public as a whole.

               Mobile home parks provide alternative forms of housing and add to the diversity of
               affordable housing opportunities for the residents of unincorporated Miami-Dade County.
               It is the goal of the Board of County Commissioners of Miami-Dade County to preserve
               the diversity and stock of low cost housing alternatives. The Board of County Commissioners
               and the Community Zoning Advisory Boards will evaluate the impacts to the available
               supply of this form of low cost housing when hearing zoning applications to change
               the use of land which is an existing mobile home park.
