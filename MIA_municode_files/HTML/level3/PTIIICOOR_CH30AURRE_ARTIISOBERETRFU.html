               The authority to create a redevelopment trust fund ("the fund"), as defined in Section
               163.387, Florida Statutes, is hereby delegated to the City of Miami Beach pursuant
               to the provisions of Section 163.410, Florida Statutes, solely with respect to the
               area known as South Beach, which is generally bounded by Sixth Street on the north,
               Government Cut on the south, the Atlantic Ocean on the east, and Biscayne Bay on the
               west, and is legally described in the amended and restated redevelopment plan ("the
               community redevelopment project area"). This delegation is made subject to the provisions
               of Resolution No. R-88-77, adopted on February 1, 1977, Resolution No. R-52-78, adopted
               on January 17, 1978, and Resolution No. R-646-79, adopted on June 1, 1979, and so
               much therein as has been replaced by Resolution No. R-612-82, adopted on May 4, 1982,
               and by Resolution No. R-1056-84, adopted on September 4, 1984, and the implementation
               of the amended and restated redevelopment plan presented to the Board, the prior approval
               of which plan is hereby affirmed and ratified. This delegation is made so that the
               City may proceed with the implementation of a plan for redevelopment, and the acquisition
               of property and redevelopment of the aforesaid area through its municipally created
               community redevelopment agency.
