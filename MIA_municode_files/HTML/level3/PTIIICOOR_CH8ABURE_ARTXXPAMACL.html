               as part of this moratorium ordinance. The Board of County Commissioners finds that
               it is in the best interest of and for the benefit of the health, safety, and welfare
               of the residents of Miami-Dade County to institute a temporary moratorium on the issuance
               of pain clinic registrations, occupational licenses/taxes, certificates of use, permits
               and development orders so that Miami-Dade County can investigate the complaints surrounding
               pain clinics including, but not limited to, illegal drug use and distribution, increased
               crime, drug-related deaths and addictions and other nuisance activities as well as
               study the effectiveness of recent legislative action, CS/CS/HB 7095 Engrossed 3, in
               addressing these complaints. For the duration of this temporary moratorium, the County
               shall cease accepting applications or requests for issuance of pain clinic registrations,
               occupational licenses/taxes, certificates of use, permits and development orders from
               pain clinics not registered with the State of Florida Department of Health as of the
