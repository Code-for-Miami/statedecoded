            <p class="p0" align="left">
               The Authority is hereby authorized to provide for the issuance of revenue bonds for
               the purpose of refunding any of its revenue bonds then outstanding, including the
               payment of any redemption premium thereon and any interest accrued or to accrue to
               the earliest or subsequent date of redemption, purchase, or maturity of such revenue
               bonds. The proceeds of any such revenue bonds issued for the purpose of refunding
               outstanding revenue bonds may, in the discretion of the Authority, be applied to the
               purchase or retirement at maturity or redemption of such outstanding revenue bonds
               either on their earliest or any subsequent redemption date, or upon the purchase or
               at the maturity thereof, and may, pending such application, be placed in escrow to
               be applied to such purchase or retirement at maturity or redemption on such date as
               may be determined by the Authority. Any such escrowed proceeds, pending such use,
               may be invested and reinvested in direct obligations of the United States, in any
               obligations of which the principal and interest are unconditionally guaranteed by
               the United States, in certificates of deposit or time deposits secured by direct obligations
               of the United States, or in any obligations of which the principal and interest are
               unconditionally guaranteed by the United States, maturing at such time or times as
               shall be appropriate to assure the prompt payment, as to principal, interest, and
               redemption premium, if any, of the outstanding revenue bonds to be so refunded. The
               interest, income, and profits, if any, earned or realized on any such investment may
               also be applied to the payment of the outstanding revenue bonds to be so refunded.
               After the terms of the escrow have been fully satisfied and carried out, any balance
               of such proceeds and interest, income, and profits, if any, earned or realized on
               the investments thereof may be returned to the Authority for use by it in any lawful
               manner. All such revenue bonds issued for the purposes of refunding shall be subject
               to the provisions of this article in the same manner and to the same extent as other
               revenue bonds issued pursuant to this article.

               The exercise of the powers granted by this article will be in all respects for the
               benefit of the people of this County, for the increase of their commerce, welfare
               and prosperity, and for the improvement of their health and living conditions. Since
               the operation and maintenance of a project by a health facility will constitute the
               performance of an essential public function, neither the Authority nor a hospital
               institution shall be required to pay any taxes or assessments upon or with respect
               to a project or any property acquired by the Authority under the provisions of this
               article or upon the income therefrom, and any bonds issued under the provisions of
               this article, their transfer, and the income therefrom, including any profit made
               on the sale thereof, shall at all times be free from taxation of every kind by the
               State, Miami-Dade County, and municipalities and other political subdivisions in the
               State, except that such income shall be subject to the tax imposed pursuant to the
               provisions of Chapter 220, Florida Statutes. Nothing in this section shall be construed
               as exempting from taxation or assessments the leasehold interest of any health facility
               organized for profit. If any project or any part thereof shall be occupied or operated
               by any health facility organized for profit pursuant to any contract or lease with
               the Authority, the property interest created by such contract or lease shall be subject
               to taxation to the same extent as other privately owned property.
