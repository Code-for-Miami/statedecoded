               Commission may be removed pursuant to the provisions of any general county ordinance
               relating to advisory boards or by the Board of County Commissioners when the member's

               be detrimental to the Commission on Disability Issues as determined by a majority
               of that Commission. The Commission on Disability Issues will make its determination
               by a formal motion and vote and the chairperson shall certify said vote to the Clerk
               of the Board of County Commissioners who shall place the matter on the next available

               an appointment to that vacancy. That Commissioner shall either recommend to the Board
               of County Commissioners one of the individuals on the list or the commissioner shall
               request a new list of three (3) people either including or excluding, at the Commissioner's
