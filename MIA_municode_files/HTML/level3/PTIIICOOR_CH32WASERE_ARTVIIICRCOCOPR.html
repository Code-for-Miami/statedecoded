               the provisions of Section 62-555.360 of the Florida Administrative Code, promulgated
               under authority of Part VI of Chapter 403, Florida Statutes by the Department of Environmental
               Protection, which requires public water systems to establish a cross-connection control
               program to detect and prevent cross-connections that create or may create an imminent
               and substantial danger to public health. In addition to internal isolation required
               by the Florida Building Code, new water customers shall provide approved backflow
               preventers next to the service connection for the containment of their premises.
