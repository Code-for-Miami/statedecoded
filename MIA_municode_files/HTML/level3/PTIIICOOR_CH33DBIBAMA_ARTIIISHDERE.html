            <p class="content2">Nothing contained herein shall be construed as depriving an applicant of lawfully
               vested rights. It shall be the duty and responsibility of the applicant alleging vested
               rights to affirmatively demonstrate the legal requisites of vested rights. Any person
               who claims a vested right to develop property contrary to this article may submit
               an application for a determination of vested rights to the Executive Council of the
               Miami-Dade County Developmental Impact Committee (DIC) together with a sworn affidavit
               setting forth the facts upon which the applicant bases his claim for vested rights.
               In addition to any other submission required by the DIC, the applicant shall include
               copies of any contracts, letters and other documents upon which a claim of vested
               rights is based. The mere existence of zoning prior to the effective date of this
               article shall not vest rights.
