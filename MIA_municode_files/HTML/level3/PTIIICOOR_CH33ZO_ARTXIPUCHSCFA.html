               It is not the intention of this article to require any changes in any public charter
               school facilities that prior to the effective date of this article have received final
               approval from the School Board of Miami-Dade County of a final charter contract specifying
               the charter school's site. Further, the provisions of this article shall not be applicable
               to the establishment of any new charter school upon demonstration of the following
               circumstances: (a) prior to the effective date of this article the proposed new charter
               school was presented during a public zoning hearing as a part of a development plan
               to the applicable Community Zoning Appeals Board or the Board of County Commissioners;
               (b) prior to or at the public hearing, the zoning applicant presenting such development
               plan provided a declaration of restrictive covenants or other recordable assurances
               binding the applicant or successor to provide a charter school at a specified location,
               with a specified maximum number of students and specified grade levels; and (c) within
               two years after the effective date of this article, the proposed new charter school
               receives a favorable recommendation for site plan approval from the Developmental
               Impact Committee and a final charter contract from the School Board of Miami-Dade
               County approving the charter school at substantially the site specified at the zoning
               public hearing.
