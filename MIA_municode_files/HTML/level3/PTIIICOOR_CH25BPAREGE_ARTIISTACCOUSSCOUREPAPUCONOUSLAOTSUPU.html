            <p class="content1">Outdoor recreational and park lands, lands qualified as environmentally endangered,
               and land and water areas containing animals or vegetation native to Miami-Dade County,
               Florida, are valued natural and ecological resources. Such lands and water areas provide
               needed open spaces for clean-air sheds, as well as for scenic, aesthetic, and conservation
               purposes. Such lands are under urban pressure from expanding metropolitan areas. This
               urban pressure takes the form of scattered development in wide belts around urban
               areas, and brings conflicting land uses into juxtaposition, creates high costs for
               public services and stimulates land speculation. The intent of the Commission is to
               provide a means by which outdoor recreational land, environmentally endangered land,
               and land and water areas containing native animals or vegetation may be protected
               and enhanced as resources of major importance. The Legislature of the State of Florida
               has recognized and has granted the authority to communities within the State to adopt
               such a procedure. This article is declared to be a proper and necessary exercise of
               the aforesaid powers.
