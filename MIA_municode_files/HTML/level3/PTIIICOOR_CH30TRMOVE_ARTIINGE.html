                  adequate to hold the vehicle on any grade on which it is operated, under all conditions
                  of loading, on a surface free of loose material. The parking brakes shall be capable
                  of being applied in conformance with the foregoing requirements by the driver's muscular
                  effort or by spring action or by equivalent means. Their operation may be assisted
                  by the service brakes or other source of power provided that failure of the service
                  brake actuation system or other power assisting mechanism will not prevent the parking
                  brakes from being applied in conformance with the foregoing requirements. The parking
                  brakes shall be so designed that when once applied they shall remain applied with
                  the required effectiveness despite exhaustion of any source of energy or leakage of
                  any kind. The same brake drums, brake shoes and lining assemblies, brake shoe anchors
                  and mechanical brake shoe actuation mechanism normally associated with the wheel brake
                  assemblies may be used for both the service brakes and the parking brakes. If the
                  means of applying the parking brakes and the service brakes are connected in any way,
                  they shall be so constructed that failure of any one (1) part shall not leave the
                  vehicle without operative brakes.
