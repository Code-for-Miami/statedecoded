               facility whose site plan was approved at public hearing seeks to relocate its playground/play
               area, such relocation shall be subject to approval after public hearing upon appropriate
               application. No fee shall be charged for such application. This subsection shall not
               be deemed to allow the future expansion of any child care facility to occur without
               complying with the requirements of Section<a href="../level3/PTIIICOOR_CH33ZO_ARTXAEDCHCAFANO.html#PTIIICOOR_CH33ZO_ARTXAEDCHCAFANO_S33-151.18PHST"> 33-151.18</a>(a). Notwithstanding any thing in the Code to the contrary the provision of this subsection
               shall apply to Miami-Dade County child care facilities.
