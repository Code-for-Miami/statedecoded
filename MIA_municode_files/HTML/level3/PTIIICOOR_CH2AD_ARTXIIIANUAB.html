               In the event that the Board declares a place or premises to be a nuisance and issues

               costs which the County has incurred in the preparation, investigation, and presentation
               of the case. These costs shall be due and payable ten (10) days after the written
               order of the Board has been filed. A certified copy of an order imposing costs may
               be recorded in the public records and thereafter shall constitute a lien against the
               land on which the violation exists or, if the violator does not own the land, upon
               any other real or personal property owned by the violator; and it may be enforced
               in the same manner as a court judgment by the sheriffs of this state including levy
               against the personal property, but shall not be deemed to be a court judgment except
               for enforcement purposes. After one year from the filing of any such lien which remains
               unpaid, Miami-Dade County may foreclose or otherwise execute on the lien. Interest
               shall accrue on the unpaid costs at the legal rate of interest set forth in Section
               55.03, Florida Statute as that may be amended from time to time.
