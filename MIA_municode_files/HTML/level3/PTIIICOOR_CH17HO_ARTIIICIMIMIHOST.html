               The County Commission hereby finds and declares that there presently exist in the
               City of Miami, Florida, structures used for human habitation which are, or may become
               in the future, substandard with respect to structure, equipment or maintenance. Further,
               that such conditions, together with inadequate provisions for light and air, insufficient
               protection against fire hazards, lack of proper ventilation for heating and cooling,
               unsanitary conditions, and overcrowding, constitute a menace to the health, safety,
               morals, welfare, and reasonable comfort of the citizens and visitors of this municipality.
               It is further found and declared that the existence of such conditions, factors, or
               characteristics, if not remedied, will create slum areas requiring large scale clearance,
               and further that, in the absence of corrective measures, such areas will experience
               a deterioration of social values, a curtailment of investment and tax revenues, and
               impairment of economic values. It is further found and declared that the establishment
               and maintenance of minimum housing standards are essential to the prevention of blight
               and decay, and the safeguarding of public health, safety, morals and welfare.

               The intent and purpose of this article is to protect the public health, safety, morals
               and welfare of all the people of the City of Miami, Florida, by establishing minimum
               standards governing the condition, occupancy, and maintenance of dwellings, dwelling
               units, rooming houses, rooming units and premises; establishing minimum standards
               governing utilities, facilities, and other physical components and conditions essential
               to make dwellings, dwelling units, rooming houses, rooming units, and premises safe,
               sanitary, and fit for human habitation; fixing certain responsibilities and duties
               of owners, operators, agents, and occupants of dwellings, and dwelling units, rooming
               houses, and rooming units; authorizing and establishing procedures for the inspection
               of dwellings, dwelling units, rooming houses, and rooming units, and the condemnation
               and vacation of those dwellings, dwelling units, rooming houses, and rooming units
               unfit for human habitation; and fixing penalties for the violations of the provisions
               of this article, and to set forth a procedure for the granting of variances to the
               enforcement of the provisions of this chapter in cases of extreme hardship, where
               the health, safety, welfare and morals of the occupants of a given unit, or the public
               at large, will not be detrimentally affected, and where literal enforcement of the

               at large. The article is hereby declared to be remedial and essential to the public
               interest, and it is intended that this article be liberally construed to effectuate
               the purposes as stated above.

               having legal right of possession thereof, or in accordance with the provisions of
               this section. When the Minimum Housing Enforcement Officer or any enforcing officer
               has reason to believe that any dwelling, dwelling unit, rooming house, rooming unit,
               hotel, hotel unit, or premises is in violation of the provisions of this article,
               or when such officer deems it necessary to make an inspection to determine whether

               such officer shall request permission to make an inspection from the person lawfully

               In the event that such person refuses to consent to the inspection, the Minimum Housing
               Enforcement Officer or enforcing officer may apply to the County Court or Circuit
               Court for the issuance of an inspection warrant to be served by an officer duly authorized
               by law to serve inspection warrants and make arrests for violations of this article.

               to be recorded among the public records of Miami-Dade County, in an appropriate book
               provided for such purpose. The recordation of such final order or other appropriate
               instrument as herein provided shall constitute constructive notice to any subsequent
               purchasers, transferees, grantees, mortgagors, mortgagees, lessees, lienors, and all
               persons having, claiming or acquiring any interest in the property described therein,
               or affected thereby. When the violations specified in the said final order shall have
               been corrected, and all costs of enforcement as provided hereinafter are paid, the
               Minimum Housing Enforcement Officer shall have recorded a certificate certifying that
               the violations have been corrected and cancelling the final order. All such final
               orders shall contain the proper legal description of the property involved. The cost
               of recording the original final order and the certificate of cancellation shall also
               be recoverable as costs from the owner of record of the property prior to recording
               the certificate of cancellation. Any person acquiring any interest in or to property
               described in a final order after recordation thereof shall be bound by the provisions
               thereof, and shall take the property subject to the requirements set forth in the
               final order. All such persons acquiring an interest in or to property for which a
               final order has been recorded under this section shall comply with the requirements
               thereof, and shall be subject to all of the other provisions of this chapter. Provided,
               however, that if the time for appeal from the final order as provided in Sections<a href="../level3/PTIIICOOR_CH17HO_ARTIIICIMIMIHOST.html#PTIIICOOR_CH17HO_ARTIIICIMIMIHOST_S17-52NOFIOR"> 17-52</a> and<a href="../level3/PTIIICOOR_CH17HO_ARTIIICIMIMIHOST.html#PTIIICOOR_CH17HO_ARTIIICIMIMIHOST_S17-57APACDEMIHOENOF"> 17-57</a> has not run as of the time of conveyance, the new owner or transferee of an interest
               in or to property shall have ten (10) days from the date upon which the transfer of
               property interest is effective as to him within which to appeal the final order to
               the Hearing Officer. If an appeal of the final order has been perfected but a final
               decision of the Hearing Officer has not been rendered, the new owner or transferee
               may exercise all of the rights of appeal which would have been accorded to the prior
               owner or transferor.

            <p class="refeditorFN"><b>Editor's note—</b>
               Article III is derived from Ord. No. 68-14, §§ 2—30, adopted March 5, 1968, effective
               ten (10) days after enactment. This ordinance was originally codified as Article II
               pursuant to the authority of § 31 thereof, which authorized its inclusion as a part of this Code. Subsequently, the
               article was redesignated Art. III in order to facilitate inclusion of § 2 of Ord.
               No. 80-87 as § 17-01 of a new Art. I of this chapter. The history note following each section indicates
               the ordinance source and the Code Comparative Table lists all ordinance sections codified
               and the Code disposition thereof.
