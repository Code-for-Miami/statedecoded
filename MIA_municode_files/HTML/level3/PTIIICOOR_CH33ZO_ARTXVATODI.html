               make efficient, economical and aesthetically pleasing use of land, so restricted that
               the same will be continually well maintained in order to preserve the health, welfare,

               As used herein, a "townhouse" is a one-family dwelling unit of a group of three (3)
               or more such units separated by a common party fire wall; provided, however, that
               up to ten (10) percent of the total number of units on any individual site plan may
               be developed in two-unit groupings. Said common party fire wall shall extend to the
               roof line or above the roof of units which it serves and shall have no openings therein.
               Where units are offset from one (1) another and a common party wall is used, the wall
               may be placed equidistant on each side of the lot line not exceeding the length of
               the offset. Each townhouse unit shall be constructed upon a separate platted lot;
               provided, however, that the roof lines may overhang onto adjacent lots or common areas
               a maximum of twenty-four (24) inches, subject to the approval of and determination
               by the Director that the roof or drainage system is designed so that runoff of water
               from the roof does not adversely affect adjacent units or lots. Each townhouse unit
               shall be serviced with separate utilities and other facilities and shall otherwise
               be independent of one (1) another; provided, however, that the electrical lines or
               telephone lines or cables which service a particular unit may be placed through other
               lots where approved by the Director. The Director's approval shall be based upon his
               finding that the placement of said lines or cables will not adversely affect the lots
               through which they are placed.
