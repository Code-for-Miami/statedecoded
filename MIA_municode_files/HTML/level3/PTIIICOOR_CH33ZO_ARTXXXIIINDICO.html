               IU-C District shall be applied only to those lands that appropriately may be used
               and utilized for the development, construction and operation of large industrial projects
               and industrial park development of the nature, type and character commensurate with
               the public health, safety, comfort, convenience, and the general welfare of the County.
               It is intended that this district shall be utilized to provide an adequate reservoir
               of lands suited for the needs and requirements of large industries, and industrial
               park developments, to the end that desirable industrial concerns may be attracted
               to this area. It is intended, however, that this district shall not be used indiscriminately,
               so as to permit any industrial use which might be offensive or obnoxious by reason
               of the emanation of odors, gases, dust, noise or vibration, pollution of air or water,
               or otherwise detrimental to the general welfare of this community; but that it shall
               be restricted and confined to only those large industrial uses and industrial park
               type developments which produce a net gain to the community. It is recognized that
               the rapid development of new and different industrial uses and operations makes it
               impossible and impractical to accurately enumerate those which would be beneficial
               or detrimental to the welfare of this community. Therefore, the intent and purpose
               for the establishment of this district is expressly set forth, and standards set forth
               for the use of lands embraced within this district.

               No use whatsoever shall be permitted in a IU-C District until the applicant for the
               use shall have filed a written application specifying the use and containing such
               detailed information and certified reports as may be reasonably required to determine

               comfort, convenience and general welfare of the community and in compliance with other
               Code provisions. Such written report shall be filed in triplicate with the Director,
               and shall be reviewed, studied and considered by the Department and such other appropriate
               department or governmental unit that may be interested or may regulate the use. Said
               agency shall promptly make a written report of its findings and recommendations to
               the Director, and simultaneously furnish a copy thereof to the applicant. The proposed
               use shall be permitted unless the aforesaid report shows that the proposed use would
               be detrimental to the public health, safety, comfort, convenience or general welfare
               of the County, or that the proposed use would be offensive or obnoxious by reason
               of the emission of odors, gases, dust, noise or vibration, or would cause any pollution
               of the air or water, or otherwise would be contrary to the intent and purpose of this
               chapter. If the aforesaid report and findings are favorable to the applicant, and
               it is recommended that the proposed use be permitted, then the Director shall issue
               appropriate permits and permit the use requested and set forth in the application.
               If such report is unfavorable to the applicant, no permits shall be issued and the
               requested use shall not be permitted; provided the applicant has a right of appeal
