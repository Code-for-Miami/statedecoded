               The Department shall review plans for compliance with zoning regulations and for compliance
               with the site plan review criteria. The purpose of the site plan review is to encourage
               logic, imagination, innovation and variety in the design process and thereby ensure
               the congruity of the proposed development and its compatibility with the surrounding
               area. All plans submitted to the Department shall be reviewed and approved or denied
               within fifteen (15) days from the date of submission. The applicant shall have the
               right to extend the fifteen-day period by an additional fifteen (15) days upon timely
               request made in writing to Department. The Departments shall have the right to extend
               the fifteen-day period by written notice to the applicant that additional information
               is needed to process the site plan. Denials shall be in writing and shall specifically
               set forth the grounds for denial. If the plan is disapproved the applicant may appeal
               to the appropriate Community Zoning Appeals Board in accordance with procedure established
               for appeals of administrative decision.
