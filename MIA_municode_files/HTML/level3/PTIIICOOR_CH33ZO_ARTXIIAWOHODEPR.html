               <i>Need for workforce housing in Miami-Dade County.</i> The health, safety, and welfare of the present and future residents of Miami-Dade
               County depend on the availability of a range of housing choices affordable to persons
               and families of all income levels in all areas of Miami-Dade County. Current patterns
               of development have resulted in a persistent shortage of housing for certain sectors
               of the community. Studies of market demand show that for the foreseeable future more
               than 50% of the new labor force in Miami-Dade County will require moderately priced
               housing units. Currently, there exists in Miami-Dade County a shortage of housing
               affordable to individuals and families of moderate incomes, particularly those whose
               earnings range from 65% to 140% of the County's median income, the "workforce target
               income group." The workforce target income group includes many public employees and
               others employed in key occupations that support the local community. Increasingly,
               the high cost and short supply of housing affordable to persons and families of moderate
               income mean that many employees in the workforce target income group cannot afford
               to live in Miami-Dade County, while others can only afford to live in areas concentrated
               according to price and income level.
            </p>
            		
            <p class="p0" align="left">
               The uneven distribution of moderately-priced housing results in additional stratification
               of housing according to price and income level. It is in the best interests of the
               public health, safety, and welfare of the present and future residents of Miami-Dade
               County to reduce or eliminate such economic stratification by adopting land use regulations
               that encourage development of land available for residential use in Miami-Dade County
               in a manner that emphasizes integration of new housing for individuals and families
               in the workforce target income group into new, expanding, or redeveloping neighborhoods.
               
               
            </p>
            <p class="b0" align="left">
               The uneven geographic distribution of housing affordable to the workforce target income
               group, as well as the distance between jobs and available housing, also increase traffic
               congestion and decrease economic productivity. Traffic and roadway congestion in turn
               adversely affect the environment and diminish air quality, increasing the burden on
               the public health care system and resulting in rising health care costs. The public
               health, safety, and welfare of the present and future residents of Miami-Dade County
               can best be protected by adopting land use policies to ensure that housing affordable
               to the workforce target income group is distributed throughout the county near workplaces,
               rather than being concentrated in enclaves separate from jobs and higher-priced housing.

               The Florida Growth Management Act requires Miami-Dade County to adopt a comprehensive
               plan to guide future development and growth, including a housing element consisting
               of standards, plans, and principles to be followed in the provision of housing for
               all current and anticipated future residents. Exercising the authority conferred by
               the Miami-Dade County Home Rule Charter, and in furtherance of the Growth Management
               Act, the Board of County Commissioners has adopted the Comprehensive Development Master
               Plan ("CDMP"), including a housing element which establishes goals, objectives, and
               policies to ensure the provision of all variations of affordable housing products
               to meet the spatial and economic necessities of all current and future residents regardless
               of household type or income.

               <i>Causes and consequences of lack of sufficient workforce housing supply.</i> In order to assess the extent of the housing shortage, identify the most severely
               affected sectors of the community, and ascertain the need for a workforce housing
               development program, the Board of County Commissioners established a task force consisting
               of county housing, zoning, and planning professionals, and representatives of the
               private, for-profit, development community. The mission of the task force was to analyze
               the current and anticipated future make-up of Miami-Dade County's workforce and population,
               the geographic distribution of moderately-priced housing, historical and current patterns
               of development applications and approvals, the distance between jobs and housing for
               the workforce target income group, the overall impact of the housing shortage on the
               economy of Miami-Dade County, and the adverse consequences failure to act would have
               on the health, safety, welfare, comfort, and convenience of the present and future
               residents of Miami-Dade County. The need for the workforce housing development program
               as identified by the task force is the result of a variety of factors, including,
               but not limited to, those noted below.

               <i>Increasing population pressure.</i> Miami-Dade County, in both the incorporated and unincorporated areas, is experiencing
               a rapid increase in the numbers of residents in the workforce target income group,
               including persons with fixed or reduced incomes, young adults forming new households,
               minority households, single adults, and many public employees and others in key occupations
               serving the entire community including teachers, police and public safety personnel,
               health care workers and mid-level management workers. Studies show that, as a result
               of this population increase, for the foreseeable future more than one-half of the
               new labor force in Miami-Dade County will require workforce housing.

               <i>Cost burdens.</i> Households in Miami-Dade County suffer from a high and increasing housing cost burden.
               Households have traditionally been regarded as "cost burdened" if they spend more
               than 30% of their gross income on housing costs. In Miami-Dade County, nearly 51%
               of all renter households pay more than 30% of their income in gross rent. In owner-occupied
               units, more than 36% of all households pay more than 30% of their income on housing.

               <i>Inadequate housing supply for the workforce target income group.</i> Current patterns of development, the costs of acquiring land suitable for residential
               development, and the disposition of remaining developable land have resulted in an
               abundance of higher-priced housing and a shortage of housing economically attainable
               by the workforce target income group. With the exception of housing developed with
               government subsidies, privately developed new residential housing being built in Miami-Dade
               County generally is not affordable to the workforce target income group. Experience
               indicates that state and federal funds for the construction of affordable housing
               will not address the housing needs of the workforce target income group.

            <p class="content2">
               <i>Overcrowding.</i> Overcrowding is a major problem in Miami-Dade County. The problem is acute in low
               to moderate income households and households in the workforce target income group.
               Analyses indicate nearly 20% of all housing units in Miami-Dade County are overcrowded.

            <p class="content2">
               <i>Concentration of housing based on economic status.</i> Demographic analyses indicate that development applications and approvals that reduce
               the supply of land developable for residential use, and which result in a disproportionate
               amount of higher-priced housing, result in a reduced supply of housing for individuals
               and families in the workforce target income group, including young families, retired
               and elderly persons, single adults, female heads of houses, and minority households.
               Such development activity produces the undesirable and unacceptable effect of concentrating
               housing according to price, thus frustrating the policies and goals of the housing
               element of the CDMP, and increasing the threat to the public health, safety, welfare,
               comfort, and convenience of the present and future residents of Miami-Dade County.

               <i>Need for involvement of private development community.</i> Existing efforts to encourage private, for-profit, developers to construct housing
               within the economic reach of the workforce target income group have met with very
               limited success. It is apparent that the need for housing for the workforce target
               income group can only be addressed if the responsibility for ensuring a diverse and
               adequate supply of housing is shared by Miami-Dade County, and the private, for-profit,
               development community.

               Consistent with the goals, objectives, and policies of the land use and housing elements
               of the CDMP, the objective of the workforce housing development program is to increase
               the supply of housing affordable to the workforce target income group, and to address
               many of the problems associated with the short supply of housing affordable to the
               workforce target income group and with the uneven, poor geographic distribution of
               such housing throughout Miami-Dade County. Through utilization of a combination of
               density bonuses, relaxation of intensity standards, flexible design criteria, and
               other incentives, the workforce housing program established herein will help alleviate
               the existing housing shortage by making it more feasible for the private, for-profit,
               development community to create and deliver a greater number of housing units affordable
               to the workforce target income group. Dispersal of workforce housing units throughout
               this community will avoid overconcentration of such housing.
