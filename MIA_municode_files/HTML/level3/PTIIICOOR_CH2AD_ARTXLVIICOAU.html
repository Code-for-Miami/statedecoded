               Access to such information shall be provided to the Commission Auditor within five
               (5) business days from the date of the Commission Auditor's request; provided, however,
               if it is not reasonably possible to comply with the Commission Auditor's request within
               five (5) business days, then access to the requested information shall be provided

               must be provided in the medium requested if the record is maintained in that medium.
               The Commission Auditor may make direct inquiries of any officer, agent, or employee
               of any department, board, agency or other County entity to clarify matters under his
               or her purview. It shall be a policy of this Board that such officer, agent or employee

               for the purpose of examining that person under oath or affirmation. All contracts

               Auditor to all financial and performance related records, property, and equipment
               purchased in whole or in part with governmental funds. The Commission Auditor shall
               have the power to summon any person to be examined under oath or affirmation. The
               Commission Auditor, or an assistant, may administer an oath or affirmation. The Commission
               Auditor may issue necessary process, including a subpoena or subpoena duces tecum,
               to compel attendance or the production of documents or other things. Prior to issuing
               a subpoena, the Commission Auditor shall notify the State Attorney and the U.S. Attorney
               for the Southern District of Florida. The Commission Auditor shall not interfere with
               any ongoing investigation of the State Attorney or the U.S. Attorney for the Southern
               District of Florida where the State Attorney or the U.S. Attorney for the Southern
               District of Florida has explicitly notified the Commission Auditor in writing that
               the Commission Auditor's investigation is interfering with an ongoing criminal investigation.
