               This Board (Board of County Commissioners) finds that many residences and nonresidential
               buildings in Miami-Dade County abut streets and easements in which water and/or sewer
               mains have been laid but obtain their water supply from wells and not from said mains.
               The sewage disposal for the said residences is provided by septic tanks. The growing
               population of Miami-Dade County, the increasing contamination of ground water, the
               easy passage of water through the porous rock and sub-soil underlying much of Miami-Dade
               County, particularly in times of heavy rains and high ground water level, combined
               with the continued use of individual wells, and septic tanks, constitutes a danger
               to the public health of Miami-Dade County and requires the extension of public water
               supply and public sewage disposal wherever it is physically feasible.

               of the notice on the property, or by publication in a newspaper, all as set forth
               in the preceding section, the connection required thereby has not been effected, the
               County Manager shall cause the connection to be effected by Miami-Dade County at the
               expense of the property owner. The cost of the said connection shall constitute a
               lien upon the real estate served thereby as is hereinafter set out. Upon ordering
               a connection to be made by the County, the County Manager shall cause to be recorded
               in the public records a Notice of Water and/or Sewer Connection Lien Pending, which
               shall include a description of the property and a statement that a connection has

               be null and void and constitute no record notice of a pending lien. After causing
               the connection to be effected the County Manager shall certify to the Director of

               by the appropriate Miami-Dade County agency, incurred in effecting the connection
               and shall include a copy of the notice above described, whereupon such expense shall
               become payable within ninety (90) days, after which a special assessment lien and
               charge will be made upon the property, which shall be payable in ten (10) equal annual
               installments together with costs of recordation of all documents required to be recorded
               hereby and with interest at the rate of six (6) percent per annum on the unpaid balance
               from the date of such certification until paid; provided, however, that the said lien
               may be satisfied at any time by the payment of the entire sum due plus accrued interest,
               recordation costs, and such expenses and penalties as may result from the advertisement
               and sale of certificates for delinquent liens as hereinafter set out. The Director
               of Finance shall file for record a notice of such lien in the Office of the Clerk
               of the Circuit Court, and shall keep complete records relating to the amount payable
               thereon. One-tenth of the amount of liens accruing during any year ending on June
               first, shall be billed and mailed in the fall of the same year to the owners of land
               subject to such liens at the same time as tax statements for ad valorem taxes are
               mailed, and if the said amount shall not be paid on or before April first of the following
               year, the entire lien and all annual installments thereof shall be delinquent, overdue,
               and in default, and the entire amount of the lien shall be collected in the same manner
               as delinquent taxes by advertisement and sale of certificates. Upon full payments
               of liens provided hereby or tax sale certificates resulting therefrom, the Director
               of Finance shall, by appropriate means, evidence the satisfaction and cancellation
               of such lien upon the public records. The cost of recordation of the notice of water
               and sewer connection lien pending, the notice of lien, and the satisfaction of lien
               shall be secured by the lien hereby provided.
