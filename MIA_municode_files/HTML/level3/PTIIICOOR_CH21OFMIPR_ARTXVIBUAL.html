               <i>False burglar alarm</i> means a signal from a burglar alarm system that elicits a response by the Police
               when no emergency or actual or threatened criminal activity requiring immediately
               response exists. This definition includes signals activated by negligence, accident,
               mechanical failure, and electrical failure; signals activated intentionally in nonemergency
               situations; and signals for which the actual cause of activation is unknown. It is
               a rebuttable presumption that a burglar alarm is false if personnel responding from
               the Police Department do not discover any evidence of unauthorized entry, criminal
               activity, or other emergency after following normal Police procedures in investigating
               the incident. An alarm is not false if the alarm user proves that (1) an individual
               activated the alarm based upon a reasonable belief that an emergency or actual or
               threatened criminal activity requiring immediate response existed; or (2) the alarm
               system was activated by lightning or an electrical surge that caused physical damage
               to the system, as evidenced by the testimony of a licensed alarm system contractor
               who conducted an on-site inspection and personally observed the damage to the system;
               or (3) if the user experienced a power outage of four or more hours, causing the alarm
               to activate upon restoration of power, as evidenced by written documentation provided
               by Florida Power and Light Company or other applicable provider.
