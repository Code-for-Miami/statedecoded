               <i>Purpose and intent.</i> The Miami-Dade County Board of County Commissioners finds and declares that the products
               and synthetic substances described hereunder are commonly used as alternatives to
               marijuana. The Board further finds that these synthetic substances are particularly
               appealing to youth, and that these synthetic substances are potentially dangerous
               to users in the short term and that the long term effects are not yet known. The Board
               finds that the products which contain these synthetic substances often use a disclaimer
               that the product is "not for human consumption" to avoid regulations requiring the
               manufacturer to list the product's active ingredients. The Board finds drug designers
               and chemists can quickly create new synthetic drugs once federal or state law makes
               a particular synthetic drug illegal. As such, the Board finds there is a need to declare
               illegal the sale, offer for sale, purchase with intent to sell and public display
               for sale of synthetic substances that mimic illegal controlled substances that have
               not yet themselves been categorized as illegal controlled substances under federal
               or state law. The Board further finds that it is proper and necessary for the Board
               to exercise its authority to safeguard and protect the public health, safety and welfare
               by taking this action.

               <i>Purpose and intent.</i> The Miami-Dade County Board of County Commissioners finds and declares that the products
               and synthetic substances described hereunder are commonly used as alternatives to
               amphetamines, cocaine, ecstasy and other illegal drugs. The Board further finds that
               these synthetic substances are particularly appealing to youth, and that these synthetic
               substances are potentially dangerous to users in the short term and the long term
               effects are not yet known. The Board finds that the products which contain these synthetic
               substances often use a disclaimer that the product is "not for human consumption"
               to avoid regulations that require the manufacturer to list the product's active ingredients.
               The Board finds that drug designers and chemists can quickly create new synthetic
               drugs once federal or state law makes a particular synthetic drug illegal. As such,
               the Board finds there is a need to declare illegal the sale, offer for sale, purchase
               with intent to sell and public display for sale of synthetic substances that mimic
               illegal controlled substances, even though such synthetic substances have not yet
               themselves been categorized as illegal controlled substances under federal or state
               law. The Board further finds that it is proper and necessary for the Board to exercise
               its authority to safeguard and protect the public health, safety and welfare by taking
               this action.
