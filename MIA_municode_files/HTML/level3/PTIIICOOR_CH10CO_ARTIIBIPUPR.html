               <i>Management and Technical Assistance Program:</i> This program will provide direct and indirect assistance for small business development.
               Program management provides direction, coordinates access to services, and maintains
               continual communications to assure knowledge and use of available resources. Technical
               assistance will also be provided such as accounting services and business plan preparation,
               which will assist firms in developing documents needed for bonding and financial assistance
               as well as business and management workshops and seminars. CSBEs may have access to
               resources that focus on developing their management capacity and enhancing the marketability
               of their products. Specific details of the proposed program are shown in Attachment
               3 [which can be found in the County Clerk's office attached to Ordinance Number 97-52].

               first tier subcontractor goal and the trade designation of work each firm will perform
               in satisfaction of a make-up, in addition to any other goals that may be applicable.
               Failure to include the required Schedule of Intent Affidavit with bids or proposals
               for any future contracts shall result in the submittal being deemed nonresponsive.
               Any contractor subject to an approved Make-up Plan that fails to comply with any of
               the material terms of that Make-up plan, without good cause, shall be subject to an
               automatic suspension from bidding and/or otherwise participating on County contracts
               as a prime or subcontractor for a six (6) month period. A contractor that fails to
               comply with any of the material terms of a second Make-up plan, without good cause,
               shall be subject to an automatic suspension from bidding and/or otherwise participating
               on County contracts as a prime or subcontractor for a one (1) year period. A contractor
               that fails to comply with any of the material terms of a third Make-up plan, without
               good cause, may be subject to debarment and shall automatically be referred to the
               debarment committee. After serving a debarment for failure to satisfy a make-up plan
               for no good cause, the subject firm shall be deemed ineligible for bidding on county
               contracts with measures for 1 additional year unless the County Mayor or designee
               determines that an emergency exists justifying such participation, and the Board of
               County Commissioners approves such decision. The foregoing obligation shall be in
               addition to any CSBE measure otherwise applicable to the future contract.
