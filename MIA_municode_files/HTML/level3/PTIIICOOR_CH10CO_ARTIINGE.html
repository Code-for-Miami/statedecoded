               All contractors holding certificates of competency issued pursuant to this chapter
               shall maintain at all times with an insurance company authorized to do business in
               the State of Florida public liability insurance with limits of liability not less
               than three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000.00) per accident or occurrence for bodily
               injury and fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) per accident for property damage. It
               shall be the responsibility of all persons holding certificates of competency issued
               pursuant to this chapter or the Florida Statutes and doing business within Miami-Dade
               County, Florida, to ensure that the originals of certificates, signed by a qualified
               agent of the insurer, shall be filed with the Secretary of the Board showing the name
               of the insurer, the type of policy issued, the policy number, the inception and expiration
               dates of the policy, and the limits of liability, and that the Secretary of the Board
               or his designee will be notified by registered or certified mail of any material change
               in the policy or its cancellation. The insurance shall provide by endorsement of the
               policy that the insurer shall notify the Secretary of the Board by certified or registered
               mail of the intent to cancel the policy for any reason, at least thirty (30) days
               prior to such cancellation. When a contractor holding a certificate of competency
               issued pursuant to this chapter cancels the insurance required by this section or
               is notified by his insurer that such insurance is being canceled, the contractor will
               immediately submit to the Secretary of the Board or his designee a list of outstanding
               permits which he has been issued but for which the work thereunder has not yet been
               completed. Such list will include the permit number, address of the work under permit
               and the name of the agency issuing the permit, together with an estimate of the percentage
               of the work that has been completed under the outstanding permits; provided, however,
               that no such list will be required if the contractor whose insurance has been canceled
               has already obtained the required insurance from an alternate insurer and has filed
               the above required certificate from the insurer. By affixing his signature to any
               application for a permit, the qualifying agent for a contractor will be considered
               to have thereby certified that the insurance required by this section has been obtained
               by the contractor he qualifies and that such insurance is in full force and effect.
