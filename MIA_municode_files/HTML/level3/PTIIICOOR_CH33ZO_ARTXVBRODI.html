               It is the intent of these regulations to create a Rowhouse District to be applied
               in unincorporated Miami-Dade County. Further, it is the purpose and intent of these
               regulations to create developments at a pedestrian scale; to create a streetscape
               which is convenient and comfortable for walking; to form a clear edge of public and
               private buildings, spatially delineating the public street space from private block
               interiors; to encourage pedestrian interaction between the development site and public
               areas; to provide a range of building elevations; to provide an identity, visual interest
               and diversity, and to provide opportunities for citizens to know their neighbors and
               watch over their collective security.

               As used herein, a "rowhouse" is a one-family dwelling unit of a group of three (3)
               or more such units, each separated from the next by a common party fire wall; provided,
               however, that up to ten (10) percent of the total number of units on any individual
               site plan may be developed in two-unit groupings. Each common party fire wall shall
               extend to the roof line or above the roof of the units it serves and shall have no
               openings therein. Where units are offset from one another and a common party wall
               is used, the wall may be placed equidistant on each side of the lot line not exceeding
               the length of the offset. Each rowhouse unit shall be constructed upon a separate
               platted lot; provided, however, that the roof eaves may overhang onto adjacent lots
               or common areas a maximum of twenty-four (24) inches, subject to the approval of and
               determination by the Director that the roof or drainage system is designed so that
               runoff of water from the roof does not adversely affect adjacent units or lots. Each
               rowhouse unit shall be serviced with separate utilities and other facilities and shall
               otherwise be independent of one another.

               The Department shall review plans for compliance with zoning regulations and for compliance
               with the site plan review criteria. Requirements shall include conformance with the
               standards contained in regulations, herein. Substantial conformance with the Urban
               Design Guidelines and Policies of the Comprehensive Development Master Plan shall
               be incorporated. The purpose of the site plan review is to encourage logic, imagination,
               innovation and variety in the design process and thereby insure the congruity of the
               proposed development and its compatibility with the surrounding area. All plans submitted
               to the Department shall be reviewed and approved or denied by the Department within
               twenty-one (21) days from the date of submission. The applicant shall have the right
               to extend the twenty-one (21) day period by an additional twenty-one (21) days upon
               timely request made in writing to the Department. The Department shall have the right
               to extend the twenty-one (21) day period by written notice to the applicant that additional
               information is needed to process the site plan. Denials shall be in writing and shall
               specifically set forth the grounds for denial. If the plan is disapproved the applicant
               may appeal to the appropriate Community Zoning Appeals Board in accordance with procedure
               established for appeals of administrative decisions.
