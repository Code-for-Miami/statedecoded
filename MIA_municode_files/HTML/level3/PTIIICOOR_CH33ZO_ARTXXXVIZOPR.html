               <i>Purpose.</i> The purpose of this subsection is to create objective standards to regulate the site-specific
               development of single-family and duplex uses in specified zoning districts. The standards
               provided in this subsection are alternatives to the generalized standards contained
               in regulations governing the specified zoning districts. The site development standards
               permit alternative patterns of site development in accordance with the Comprehensive
               Development Master Plan ("CDMP") where the public interest served by the underlying
               district regulations and CDMP will be served, and the objectives of the creative urban
               design, urban infill development and redevelopment, or the preservation and enhancement
               of property values will be promoted, as demonstrated by the proposed alternative development's
               compliance with the standards of this subsection. A zoning application for development
               in compliance with the alternative standards shall be approved upon demonstration
               at public hearing that the proposed development is in compliance with the applicable
               alternative standards and does not contravene the enumerated public interest standards
               established herein.

               common open space. A reduction in a particular lot's interior side setback may warrant
               the provision of additional landscaping.

               and the immediate vicinity in a manner comparable to that ensured by the underlying
               district regulations. Examples of such amenities include but are not limited to: active
               or passive recreational facilities, common open space, additional trees or landscaping,
               convenient covered bus stops or pick-up areas for transportation services, sidewalks
               (including improvements, linkages, or additional width), bicycle paths, buffer areas
               or berms, street furniture, undergrounding of utility lines, and decorative street
               lighting. In determining which amenities or buffering elements are appropriate for
               a proposed development, the following shall be considered:

               of additional common open space. A reduction in a particular lot, parcel, or tract's
               interior side setback may warrant the provision of additional landscaping.

               the site in question, to remand to the Community Zoning Appeals Boards, or for any
               other justifiable and reasonable reason. Whenever a deferral is approved at the request
               of the applicant, the applicant shall be required to pay a deferral fee in the amount
               of round-trip public transit fare for each person present at the hearing in opposition
               to the application, or two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00), whichever is greater.
               The Clerk of the Board shall prepare and have available at the hearing appropriate
               voucher forms, in duplicate, to be filed under oath by persons present to oppose the
               application in question. Each objector presenting a completed voucher to the Clerk
               shall be given two (2) transit tokens. At the end of the meetings at which the deferral
               was requested, the Clerk shall, for each deferral, total the number of vouchers issued,
               determine the value of transit fares represented by the tokens, and submit the deferral
               fee to the applicant, or his attorney. The applicant requesting the deferral shall
               pay the deferral fee to the Department, which shall then pay an amount equal to the
               value of the transit fares to the transit agency. Except for that portion of the deferral
               fee paid to the transit agency, all monies collected by the Department as deferral
               fees shall be deposited into a separate account and shall be expended only for purposes
               of administering and enforcing the provisions hereof. In the event that the applicant
               does not pay the deferral fee prior to the date of the scheduled deferred hearing,
               the application shall be deemed to have been voluntarily withdrawn without prejudice,
               the applicant shall be deemed to be in violation of this provision, and enforcement

               by condition or otherwise, hereinafter the covenant proviso, where the covenant has

               process shall be the same as for the appeal of an application seeking the approvals
               contained in the prior resolution. No application under this section shall be filed

               has not been recorded as evidenced by a title search or attorney's opinion of title
               current to within 30 days of filing this application, and (b) states under oath why
               it is not reasonably practicable for said covenant to be timely recorded as contemplated

               may apply to the Court for relief unless such person has first exhausted the remedies
               provided for herein and taken all available steps provided in this article. It is
               the intention of the Board of County Commissioners that all steps as provided by this
               article shall be taken before any application is made to the Court for relief; and
               no application shall be made to the Court for relief except from a resolution adopted
               by the Board of County Commissioners, or where applicable from a resolution adopted
               by a Community Zoning Appeals Board pursuant to this article. Zoning resolutions of
               the Board of County Commissioners, or where applicable, zoning resolutions of Community
               Zoning Appeals Boards shall be reviewed in accordance with the procedure and within
               the time provided by the Florida Rules of Appellate Procedure for the review of the
               quasi-judicial rulings of any commission or board; and such time shall commence to
               run from the date the zoning resolution sought to be reviewed is transmitted to the
               Clerk of the Commission. The Director, or his duly authorized representative, shall
               affix to each zoning resolution the date said zoning resolution is transmitted to
               the Clerk of the Commission. The Clerk of the Board shall comply with all requirements
               of the Florida Rules of Appellate Procedure. For the purposes of appeal the Director
               shall make available, for public inspection and copying, the record upon which each
               final decision of the Board of County Commissioners or Community Zoning Appeals Board
               is based; provided, the Director may make a reasonable charge commensurate with the
               cost in the event the Department is able to and does furnish copies of all or any
               portion of the record. Prior to certifying a copy of any record or portion thereof,
               the Director or his designee shall make all necessary corrections in order that the
               copy is a true and correct copy of the record, or those portions requested, and shall
               make a charge as provided by administrative order as amended from time to time for
               preparation of the record, instrument maps, picture or other exhibit; provided, the
               charges here authorized are not intended to repeal or amend any fee or schedule of
               fees otherwise established. The Chair, Vice-chair or Acting Chair of the Board of
               County Commissioners or Community Zoning Appeals Board at any zoning hearing before
               the Commission or Community Zoning Appeals Board may swear witnesses and, upon timely
               request in writing, compel the attendance of witnesses in the same manner prescribed
               in the Circuit Court. The Director shall employ a qualified court reporter to report
               the proceedings before the Board of County Commissioners and Community Zoning Appeals
               Board, who shall transcribe the notes only at the request of the County or other interested
               party, at the expense of the one (1) making the request. Such transcript, as well
               as the transcript of the proceedings before the Community Zoning Appeals Board, when
               certified by the reporter, may be used in a court review of a matter in issue.

               It is the intent of the Board of County Commissioners that no decision under this

               abrogation of vested rights (taking or vested rights deprivation). In the event that

               Community Zoning Appeals Board under this chapter constitutes a taking or vested rights
               abrogation, such decision of the board is declared to be non-final and the court is
               hereby requested to remand the matter to the Board of County Commissioners, which
               shall reconsider the matter after notice of the County Commission hearing is given

               County Commissioners after finding that a taking or vested rights abrogation has occurred,
               the director is instructed to forthwith file an application to remedy such taking
               or vested rights abrogation, which application shall be heard directly by the Board
               of County Commissioners after notice is given pursuant to<a href="../level3/PTIIICOOR_CH33ZO_ARTXXXVIZOPR.html#PTIIICOOR_CH33ZO_ARTXXXVIZOPR_S33-310NOHEPRACCOZOAPBOBOCOCO"> Section 33-310</a>(c) through (f). The Board of County Commissioners may elect to request that any remand
               or director's application be deferred until a later point in the litigation, including
               the completion of any judicial appeals. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
               in this chapter, the Board of County Commissioners shall have original administrative
               jurisdiction over any remand or director's application pursuant to this paragraph.
