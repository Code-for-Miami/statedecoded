               The County Commission hereby finds and declares that there presently exist in Metropolitan
               Miami-Dade County, Florida, structures used for human habitation which are, or may
               become in the future, substandard with respect to structure, equipment or maintenance.
               Further, that such conditions, together with inadequate provision for light and air,
               insufficient protection against fire hazards, lack of proper ventilation for heating
               and cooling, insanitary conditions, and overcrowding, constitute a menace to the health,
               safety, morals, welfare, and reasonable comfort of the citizens and visitors to this
               metropolitan area. It is further found and declared that the existence of such conditions,
               factors, or characteristics, if not remedied, will create slum areas requiring large-scale
               clearance, and further that, in the absence of corrective measures, such areas will
               experience a deterioration of social values, a curtailment of investment and tax revenues,
               and impairment of economic values. It is further found and declared that the establishment
               and maintenance of minimum housing standards are essential to the prevention of blight
               and decay, and the safeguarding of public health, safety, morals and welfare.

               The intent and purpose of this article is to protect the public health, safety, morals
               and welfare of all the people of Metropolitan Miami-Dade County, Florida, by establishing
               minimum standards governing the condition, occupancy, and maintenance of dwellings,
               dwelling units, rooming houses, rooming units and premises; establishing minimum standards
               governing utilities, facilities, and other physical components and conditions essential
               to make dwellings, dwelling units, rooming houses, rooming units, and premises safe,

               of owners, operators, agents, and occupants of dwellings, and dwelling units, rooming

               and vacation of those dwellings, dwelling units, rooming houses, and rooming units
               unfit for human habitation; and fixing penalties for the violations of the provisions
               of this article, and to set forth a procedure for the granting of variances to the
               enforcement of the provisions of this chapter in cases of extreme hardship, where
               the health, safety, welfare and morals of the occupants of a given unit, or the public

               The provisions of this article shall be applicable as a minimum standard in incorporated
               and unincorporated areas of Metropolitan Miami-Dade County, Florida. Every portion
               of a building or premises used or intended to be used for any dwelling purpose, except
               temporary housing in times of local emergency, disaster or necessity, shall comply

               been constructed, altered or repaired; and irrespective of any permits or licenses
               which shall have been issued for the use or occupancy of the building or premises,
               for the construction or repair of the building, or for the installation or repair
               of equipment or facilities, prior to the effective date of this article. This article
               is intended and shall be construed as establishing minimum standards for the initial
               and continued occupancy of all buildings. It is not intended to replace, modify, supersede
               or diminish the standards established for the construction, repair, alteration or
               use of buildings, equipment or facilities by the South Florida Building Code (Ordinance
               No. 57-22, as amended). In any case where any provision of this article is found to
               be in conflict with a material and controlling provision of zoning regulations, the
               South Florida Building Code, or any other County or municipal ordinance, code or regulation,
               or any rules or regulations of the Florida State Board of Health, the provision which
               establishes the highest standard shall prevail. All County and municipal departments,
               officials and employees who have the duty, responsibility or authority to issue permits
               or licenses in regard to the use and occupancy of dwellings, dwelling units, rooming
               houses, or rooming units, or similar facilities, shall conform to the provisions of
               this article, as a minimum standard. It shall be the duty and responsibility of municipal
               departments, officials and employees to enforce the minimum standards prescribed by
               the provisions of this chapter within the territorial limits of their respective municipalities.

               the Minimum Housing Enforcement Officer shall file a copy of such final order or other
               appropriate instrument indicating that violations of the minimum housing standards
               established by this article exist upon the property involved, in the office of the
               Clerk of the Circuit Court of Miami-Dade County, Florida, who shall cause the same
               to be recorded among the public records of Miami-Dade County, in an appropriate book
               provided for such purpose. The recordation of such final order or other appropriate
               instrument as herein provided shall constitute constructive notice to any subsequent
               purchasers, transferees, grantees, mortgagors, mortgagees, lessees, lienors, and all
               persons having, claiming or acquiring any interest in the property described therein,
               or affected thereby. When the violations specified in the said final order shall have
               been corrected and all costs of enforcement as provided hereinafter are paid, the
               Minimum Housing Enforcement Officer shall have recorded a certificate certifying that
               the violations have been corrected and cancelling the final order. All such final
               orders shall contain the proper legal description of the property involved. The cost
               of recording the original final order and the certificate of cancellation shall also
               be recoverable as costs from the owner of record of the property prior to recording
               the certificate of cancellation. Any person acquiring any interest in or to property
               described in a final order after recordation thereof shall be bound by the provisions
               thereof, and shall take the property subject to the requirements set forth in the
               final order. All such persons acquiring an interest in or to property for which a
               final order has been recorded under this section shall comply with the requirements
               thereof, and shall be subject to all of the other provisions of this article. Provided,

               of property interest is effective as to him within which to appeal the final order
               to the Hearing Officer. If an appeal of the final order has been perfected but a final
               decision of the Hearing Officer has not been rendered, the new owner or transferee
               may exercise all of the rights of appeal which would have been accorded to the prior
