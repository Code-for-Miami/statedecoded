               <i>Attendance Requirement</i>. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Code of Miami-Dade County, any Council
               Member shall be automatically removed if, in a given fiscal year: (i) he or she is
               absent from three (3) Council meetings, consecutive or otherwise, without an acceptable
               excuse; or (ii) whether excused or not, he or she misses two-thirds (2/3) of the Council's meetings in a given fiscal year. A member shall be deemed absent
               from a meeting when he or she is not present at the meeting at least seventy-five
               (75) percent of the time. An "acceptable excuse" is defined as an absence for medical
               reasons, business reasons, personal reasons, or any other reason, which a majority

               (I)(3) may be waived.
