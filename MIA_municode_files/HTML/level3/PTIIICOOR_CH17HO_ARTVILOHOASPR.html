               The Housing Finance Authority of Miami-Dade County, Office of Community and Economic
               Development, Miami-Dade Housing Agency or its successor department may develop a local
               housing partnership so that the implementation of the local housing assistance program
               involves other appropriate County agencies, local governments, lending institutions,
               housing developers, community based housing and service organizations, providers of
               professional services relating to affordable housing and any other persons or entities
               who can assist in providing housing or related support services. The partnership should
               encourage the use of combined resources to reduce housing costs for the targeted population.
