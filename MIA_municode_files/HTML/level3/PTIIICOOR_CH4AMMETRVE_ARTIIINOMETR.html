            <p class="content1">During the 1979 State legislative session, authority for regulation of nonemergency
               medical transportation was transferred from the Public Service Commission to the Department
               of Health and Rehabilitative Services (Chapter 401, Florida Statutes). It mandated
               the elimination of economic regulations at the State level and required each County
               to establish local control of the industry. A prior condition for obtaining a State
               license and permit is a County certificate of public convenience and necessity.

            <p class="content1">The purpose of this article is to ensure the health and safety of those citizens who
               must use nonemergency transportation. Regulation of the nonemergency medical transportation
               industry is susceptible to and can most effectively be carried out under a uniform
               plan of regulation to [of] the County as a whole.

            <p class="content1">Artificial restrictions upon the nonemergency medical transportation industry based
               solely upon economic regulations, that limit competition and impose unreasonable standards
               on the industry, are not in the best interest of the health, welfare, safety and convenience
               of the handicapped and disabled residents of the County who rely on this form of transportation.
               The riding public should not be required to bear the effects of governmentally imposed
               restrictions upon the industry which are artificial or unnecessary.

               represented by legal counsel and shall be entitled to present a defense to the proposed
               action. Failure to appear at a duly noticed hearing shall be deemed a waiver of the
               right to hearing and an admission of the acts specified in the notice. All such hearings
               shall be conducted before a hearing examiner who shall not have responsibility for
               the enforcement of this article and who shall be designated by the Director. Insofar
