               The Board finds and determines that motorboats which operate on all waters lying within
               the boundaries of Dade County at excessive speeds or in a reckless and unsafe manner
               create a situation dangerous to the lives and property of persons using said waters,
               that excessive motorboat speed erodes shoreline property and destroys bulkheads, seawalls,
               docks and piers, and that said excessive speed or the operation of motorboats in a
               reckless and unsafe manner reduces other available recreational uses for said waters.
               The board further finds and determines that because different size motorboats create
               different problems when they operate at the same speed, a flexible regulatory scheme
               is required.
