               of the action or decision to be reviewed as well as the reasons or grounds for the
               appeal. The Secretary of the Board shall set each such appeal for hearing at the earliest

               Hearsay evidence may be used for the purpose of supplementing or explaining other
               evidence, but it shall not be sufficient in itself to support a decision of the Board
               unless it would be admissible over objection in civil actions. The Chairperson of
               the Board or the attorney of the Board or a Notary Public shall have the power to

               party or upon the Board's own motion, by any means available to the courts and in
               the manner provided in the Florida Rules of Civil Procedure, including the imposition
               of sanctions, except contempt. Any person subject to a subpoena may, before compliance
               and on timely petition, request the Board to invalidate the subpoena on the grounds
               that it was not lawfully issued, is unreasonably broad in scope, or requires the production
               of irrelevant material. Any party or the Board may seek enforcement of a subpoena,
               order directing discovery, or order imposing sanctions issued hereunder by filing
               a petition for enforcement in the Circuit Court of Dade County, Florida. A failure
               to comply with an order of the Court shall result in a finding of contempt. However,
               no person shall be in contempt while a subpoena is being challenged as provided herein.
               The Court may award to the prevailing party all or part of the costs and attorneys
               fees incurred in obtaining the Court order. A party shall have the opportunity to
               respond, to present evidence and argument on all issues involved, conduct cross-examination
