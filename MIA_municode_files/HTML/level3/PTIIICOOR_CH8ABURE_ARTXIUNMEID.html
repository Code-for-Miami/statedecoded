               It is the intent of the Board of County Commissioners to provide a uniform meat identification
               system relating to the sale of meats at retail to the consumers of Miami-Dade County.
               The Board finds and determines that shoppers in Miami-Dade County's retail food stores
               are often faced with a problem of not knowing what type or quality of meat is being
               offered for sale because of misleading, false, deceptive or confusing meat labeling.
               Further, that shoppers often find that meats advertised for sale are unavailable when
               they seek to purchase such advertised meats because of limited quantities and that
               the limit on quantity was not disclosed in the advertisement. The Board finds that
               these and other practices and problems relative to the sale of meat at retail result
               in higher food costs, inconvenience and confusion to consumers. It is the intention
               of the Board that this article be liberally construed to accomplish its objective
               of providing to consumers fair information as to the meat products they purchase.
