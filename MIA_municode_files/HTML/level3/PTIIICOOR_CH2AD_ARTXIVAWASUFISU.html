               The intent of this article is to assure an adequate water supply for fire suppression
               by establishing minimum flow rates required to control and extinguish fires that may
               occur within prescribed occupancy classifications. Requirements of this article are

               land development projects. This article is further applicable to all water supply

               <i>Required fire flow.</i> The required fire flow is the rate of flow needed for firefighting purposes to confine
               a major fire to the buildings within a block or other contiguous group. The determination
               of this flow depends upon the size, construction, occupancy, and exposure of buildings
               within and surrounding the block or group of buildings, and upon the existence of
               automatic sprinkler protection. The minimum required fire flow in the various land
               use zone classifications shall be as listed in Table I.
            </p>
            		
            <p class="p0" align="left">
               A required fire flow shall be determined at appropriate locations in each district
               or section of the County. The minimum fire flow requirement is five hundred (500)
               gallons per minute (gpm) in residential areas and the maximum for a single fire is
               twelve thousand (12,000) gpm in principal business districts. Where local conditions
               indicate that consideration must be given to possible simultaneous fires, an additional
               two thousand (2,000) to eight thousand (8,000) gpm will be required. The required
               minimum duration for fire flow shall be as listed in Table II. These required fire
               flow rates shall be required in addition to the water flow rates necessary to supply
               the needs of average daily consumption.

               <i>Consumption.</i> The average daily consumption is the average of the total amount of water used each
               day during a one-year period. This average, considered as a rate for a twenty-four-hour
               period, is the average daily consumption rate. The maximum daily consumption is the
               maximum total amount used during any twenty-four-hour period (in determining this
               figure, records for at least the past three (3) years should be used, but high consumption
               that will not occur again due to changes in the system or that was caused by unusual
               operations, such as refilling of a reservoir after cleaning, should not be considered).
               This maximum considered as a rate over a twenty-four-hour period, is the maximum daily
               consumption rate; it is the average rate of consumption on the maximum day.

               at least fifty (50) percent greater than the average daily consumption in such other
               communities. The consumption rate to be used shall be the total maximum daily consumption
               rate that passes through the pumps, filters, mains, or other facilities being considered.
