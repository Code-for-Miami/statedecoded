               <i>[Responsibility; purpose; procedures generally.]</i> The Department shall review plans for compliance with zoning regulations and for
               compliance with the site plan review criteria. The purpose of the site plan review
               is to encourage logic, imagination, innovation and variety in the design process and
               encourage the congruity of the proposed development and its compatibility with the
               surrounding area. All plans submitted to the Department shall be reviewed and approved
               or denied within fifteen (15) days from the date of submission. The applicant shall
               have the right to extend the fifteen-day period by an additional fifteen (15) days
               upon request made in writing to the Department. Denials shall be in writing and shall
               specifically set forth the grounds for denial. Receipt of applicant's plans for fifteen
               (15) days without formal written denial shall constitute approval. If the plan is
               disapproved, the applicant may appeal to the appropriate Community Zoning Appeals
               Board. Appeals by the applicant shall be filed within thirty (30) days of the date
