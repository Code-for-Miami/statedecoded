                  in the list attached as Exhibit 1 to this article nor add any project to the list
                  or delete, materially change or add any project to the Five Year Implementation Plan
                  except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this subsection (e). The Five
                  Year Implementation Plan and any proposed deletion, material change or addition of
                  a County project shall be initially reviewed by the Citizens' Independent Transportation
                  Trust ("Trust"), which shall forward a recommendation thereon to the County Commission.
                  The County Commission may either accept or reject the Trust's recommendation. If the
                  County Commission rejects the recommendation, the matter shall be referred back to
                  the Trust for its reconsideration and issuance of a reconsidered recommendation to
                  the County Commission. The County Commission may approve, change or reject the Trust's
                  reconsidered recommendation. A two-thirds vote of the Commission membership shall
                  be required to take action other than as contained in the reconsidered recommendation
                  of the Trust. The foregoing notwithstanding, the list of County projects contained
                  in Exhibit 1 and the Five Year Implementation Plan may be changed as a result of the
                  MPO process as mandated by federal and state law.

                  submitted a recommendation to the County Commission regarding said contract award.
                  The County Commission, if in agreement with the Trust's recommendation, may award
                  a contract by majority vote. The County Commission may modify or reject the recommendation
                  of the Trust by a two-thirds (2/3) vote of the Commission's membership. If the Trust has failed to forward a recommendation
                  to the County Commission within 45 days of the County Mayor or his designee filing
                  his award recommendation with the Clerk of the Board, the County Commission may take
                  action on the contract award recommendation without any Trust recommendation. Notwithstanding
                  any other provision to the contrary, a committee of the Commission may consider a
                  contract award recommendation prior to receipt of a recommendation of the Trust. The
                  Trust shall, in consultation with the County Mayor or his designee, schedule Trust
                  meetings monthly so as to ensure that a Trust recommendation is provided to the Commission
