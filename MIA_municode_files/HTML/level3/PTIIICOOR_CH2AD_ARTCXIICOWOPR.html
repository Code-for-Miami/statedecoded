               to the Mayor or the Mayor's Designee whether a workforce goal should be applied to
               a Capital Construction Contract/Work Order. The contract language for a Capital Construction
               Contract/Work Order to which a local workforce goal is applied shall specify that
               a certain percentage of the workforce performing construction trades and labor work
               under such contract be residents of Designated Target Areas as provided herein.

               <i>Workforce Plan:</i> Bid and proposal documents for Capital Construction Contracts/Work Order to which
               a local workforce goal has been applied shall require the contractor, to develop and
               submit to the County, within fifteen (15) days of notification of award of the contract,
               a Workforce Plan outlining how the goal will be met and containing all of the information
               and elements required by this Section. The Plan shall specify the total number of
               persons that will be used by the contractor (as well as by all subcontractors) to
               perform all of the construction trades and labor work of the contract, broken down
               by trade and labor category, minimum qualifications for each category, and the number
               of persons to be utilized in each category. The Plan shall identify by name, address
               and trade category of all persons proposed to perform work under the contract currently
               on the contractor's (or on any proposed subcontractor's) payroll who reside in any
               Designated Target Area. The Plan shall also indicate the number of positions shown
               on the work, trade categories and minimum qualifications therefore of the positions
               to be hired by the contractor (or by any proposed subcontractors) to perform the construction
               trades and labor work under the contract. The County will not enter into the contract
               until it receives the contractor's Workforce Plan and deems the Plan acceptable. The
               contract language of a contract subject to a local workforce goal shall provide that
               in the event that at contract completion, the contractor fails to comply with the
               established local workforce goal, liquidated damages equal to a minimum of $1,500.00
               per position or the salary that would be payable for such position had the person(s)
               been hired for the position as listed on the approved workforce plan to include all
               approved revisions to the workforce plan, whichever is greater shall be withheld from
               the contractor's final payment as liquidated damages and be applied to pay part of
               the costs of the Community Workforce Program under this ordinance. An updated Plan
               shall be submitted to SBD on a monthly basis. In the event that during the contract
               time a new hire or a person identified in the Plan as already on the contractor's
               (or any proposed subcontractor's) payroll to meet the local workforce goal is replaced,
               Miami-Dade County will require the contractor to immediately contact SBD identifying
               the replacement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary above, the contractor may
               be relieved from the requirements of this ordinance, in part or in whole, if such
               contractor can demonstrate to SBD that it has utilized its best efforts to achieve
               the goal in accordance with the prescribed Implementing Order.

               the goal. Persons that reside in a DTA other than the DTA in which the public improvement
               is located, may be counted towards meeting the goal provided the first priority in
               hiring for such position was given to persons residing in the Designated Target Area
               in which the public improvement is located, and when the hiring party as well as the
               WDOs and WROs have demonstrated to SBD that they have been unable to identify a qualified
               resident of the Designated Target Area in which the public improvement is located.
