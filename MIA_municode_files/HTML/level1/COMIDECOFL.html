            This Code constitutes a recodification of the ordinances of Dade County, Florida.
            
            
         </p>
         <p class="p0" align="left">
            In the preparation of the Code, the 1957 Code, as supplemented through Ord. No. 92-20,
            adopted March 17, 1992, has been used. The section numbers assigned in the 1957 Code
            have been retained so that sections of this Code are also sections of the 1957 Code.
            The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses
            at the end thereof. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this
            Code, the reader can locate any ordinance included herein. Notes which tie related
            sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included.
            A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the
            Code is included at the back of this Code.

            <i>Numbering System</i>
            
         </p>
         <p class="p0" align="left">
            The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local
            government codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by
            a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure
            after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus,
            the second section of<a href="../level2/PTIIICOOR_CH1GEPR.html#PTIIICOOR_CH1GEPR"> Chapter 1</a> is numbered 1-2 and the first section of<a href="../level2/PTIIICOOR_CH4AMMETRVE.html#PTIIICOOR_CH4AMMETRVE"> Chapter 4</a> is<a href="../level3/PTIIICOOR_CH4AMMETRVE_ARTIINGE.html#PTIIICOOR_CH4AMMETRVE_ARTIINGE_S4-1LEIN"> 4-1</a>. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time
            new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place simply by
            using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting
            of three sections that would logically come between sections 3-1 and 3-2 is desired
            to be added, such new sections would be numbered 3-1.1, 3-1.2 and 3-1.3, respectively.
            If new material is to be included between Chapters<a href="../level2/PTIIICOOR_CH12EL.html#PTIIICOOR_CH12EL"> 12</a> and<a href="../level2/PTIIICOOR_CH13EX.html#PTIIICOOR_CH13EX"> 13</a>, it will be designated as Chapter 12A. Care should be taken that the alphabetical
            arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and
            new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be
            placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions,
            may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive
            number being assigned to the new article or division.

         <p class="p0" align="left">
            The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has
            been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology,
            others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local
            government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within each
            index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in
            which the user is interested.

            A special feature of this publication to which the attention of the user is especially
            directed is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication.
            With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date periodically. Subsequent
            amendatory legislation will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected
            will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the
            publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting
            the obsolete pages.

         <p class="p0" align="left">
            Successfully keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely
            upon the holder of the publication. As revised sheets are received, it will then become
            the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the
            attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments
            be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that
            all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.
