               <i>Geology.</i> The geology of the area is characterized by a highly transmissive water-bearing unconfined
               limestone formation known as the Biscayne Aquifer. The Biscayne Aquifer extends from
               the Broward-Palm Beach County boundary southward through all of Miami-Dade County.
               It is the sole source of potable water in Miami-Dade and Broward Counties and one
               of the most permeable aquifers in the world. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
               has recognized the importance of the Biscayne Aquifer by designating it as a sole
               source aquifer under the provisions of the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974. The aquifer
               is exposed at the surface in must of the area or is covered by a thin mantle of soil
               and/or plant material. Within the aquifer, limestones make up approximately eighty
               (80) percent of the volume of the formation. Water levels within the rock formation
               annually rise to the surface in response to summer and fall precipitation, inundating
               vast portions of the designated area.

               water basin with an elevation of approximately six (6) feet above mean sea level.
               The slough has a northeasterly to southwesterly orientation and surface water flows
               in a southwesterly direction into the Everglades National Park during the wet season.
               During the rainy season, the water rises to a level of more than two (2) feet above
               much of the land surface. This part of the critical area contains some of the most
               significant areas of true "sawgrass everglades" that are found in South Florida. The
               overall slope of the land is very slight (two-tenths (0.2) feet per mile). The occurrence
               of three (3) basic vegetative communities within this region is indicative of very
               small differences in elevation of the terrain and average period of water inundation.
               The three (3) community types are (1) hammock forest/marsh thicket; (2) the sawgrass-rush-maidencane
               marsh; and (3) the rush-sawgrass-maidencane marsh. The forest and thicket communities
               occur as "islands" on discrete areas where the ground is a few inches higher than
               the surrounding marshes. The sawgrass-dominated marsh community is distributed over
               peat deposits, but at slightly lower elevation than the tree and shrub community.
               The wet prairie dominated by rush is found at slightly lower elevation than the sawgrass
               and usually corresponds with shallow soil deposits and a longer period of inundation.

               Soils in the Shark River subarea are primarily accumulations of peat and muck which
               grade into rockland and outcrops of limestone in the south and southeast portions
               of the area. The peat soils are primarily the result of decaying sawgrass and other
               indigenous vegetation. Much of the Shark River Slough is covered by a periphyton or
               algal mat which is a complex biotic community consisting primarily of the blue-green
               and green algae, diatoms, desmids and other microscopic plants and animals. This periphyton
               community is understood to be the basis of the Everglades food web. The periphyton
               mat is dependent upon the maintenance of the natural hydroperiod for its continuation.
               In addition to its role as the primary producer in the Everglades food chain, the
               periphyton mat precipitates calcium carbonate which forms marl soil deposits. These
               marl deposits sometimes act to "cap" the rock surface in areas of the gladeland floor,

            <p class="content3">The southeast Saline Everglades is the fourth distinct physiographic province in the
               designated area. Historically, fresh water flowed during the rainy season as a vast
               sheet from the vicinity of Florida City southward to the coastal estuaries. Although
               this flow pattern has been influenced by water management works in recent years, the
               Southeast Saline Everglades remains critically linked to the functioning of the brackish
               water estuaries of Florida Bay—the nurseries for infant shrimp and fish and other
               marine animals. Basic to the immense productivity of South Florida's estuaries is
               the inflow of fresh water from this subarea which moderates estuarine salinities and
               transports detrital material and other food sources for the juvenile marine organisms.
               Salinity is one of the most important factors affecting biological productivity in
               estuaries. Estuarine salinity is greatly influenced by upstream water levels. Maintenance
               of a broad brackish zone and a gradual salinity gradient in the coastal estuaries
               is a critical function of the sheet flow from the Southeast Saline Everglades. This
               salinity regime must be maintained if the high productivity of commercial fisheries
               is to be maintained. The soils of this area are marls and peats, often in overlying
               layers. Portions of the Southeast Saline Everglades have been designated by the Secretary
               of the Interior as critical habitat for the American crocodile. Other portions have
               been designated as critical habitat for the Cape Sable sparrow. An active eagle nest

               subarea to five (5) feet above MSL in the Shark River Slough to less than one (1)

               supply of high quality water flowing overland across the park and into Florida Bay.
               The continued supply of high quality fresh water to the intertidal nursery zones of
               Florida Bay and the Ten Thousand Islands is essential to the maintenance of paneid
               shrimp, oyster, menhaden and other fisheries of the Florida coast, the Gulf of Mexico

               Furthermore, waters within Everglades National Park have been designated by the United
