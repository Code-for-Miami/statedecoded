               In order to protect and preserve the public and private resources of the East Everglades
               and to achieve the goals and objectives of the East Everglades Resources Planning
               Project, it is necessary and appropriate to create a system of comprehensive land
               management and development regulations for the East Everglades Area of Critical Environmental
               Concern. This division is adopted in order to protect the East Everglades resources
               and to limit growth and development in the area to that development which is compatible
               with the long term integrity of the public and private economic and environmental
               values of the East Everglades. This division is in furtherance of the goals and objectives
               of Ordinance No. 81-1 [Division 1 of Article II of this chapter].
