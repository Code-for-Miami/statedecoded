               The hearing examiner shall have the power to administer oaths. When an appeal has

               may subpoena witnesses and may, with the approval of the Manager, compel the production

               fail to compel the production of books, records or papers, then and in either event,
               any interested party may, without cost to the petitioner, petition the court of appropriate
               jurisdiction to order the appearance of any witness or witnesses or order the production
               of any books, records or papers necessary to a fair and proper hearing before the
               hearing examiner. Failure of any witness ordered to appear or failure of any person
               ordered to produce books, records or papers may constitute a contempt of court and
               may be punishable as may any other contempt of the court of appropriate jurisdiction.
               If any witness fails to honor a subpoena, the party requesting the same may apply
               to the court of appropriate jurisdiction for a rule to show cause why the witness
               should not appear and if after being ordered to appear by the court, the witness fails
               to comply therewith, the court after due notice and hearing may adjudge the witness
               in contempt of court and punish him accordingly. The subpoenaing party shall bear
               the cost of such subpoena.
