               Each water or sewer utility shall collect from its customers and pay to the County

               dollars ($100.00) of the receipts of said utility derived from its water and/or sewer

               before each December 1 shall obligate the utility to pay to the County a late charge.
               Said late charge shall be one and one-half (1½) percent of the unpaid balance of the
               fee for each month or part of each month that the fee remains unpaid.
