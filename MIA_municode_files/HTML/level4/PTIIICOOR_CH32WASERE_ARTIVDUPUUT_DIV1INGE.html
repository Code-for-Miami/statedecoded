               utility derived from its operations conducted within the County pursuant to the authorization

               owned or operated public utility shall be applicable only to gross revenues derived
               from sales made to consumers not within the boundaries of said municipality. Each
               annual service fee shall be based on such gross revenues for the twelve-month period
               ending on the anniversary date of said certificate and shall be payable on the first
               day of the first month following said anniversary date, except that the annual service
               fee due from each municipality shall be due and payable on November first each year
               and shall be based upon the revenues for the twelve (12) months ending September thirtieth
               of that year. Each municipal utility may increase its rates so as to pass through,
               to its customers, the service fee imposed upon said utility by this section. On a
               one-time basis only, said rates may be increased after filing and review by the Board
               without the necessity of notice and public hearing as provided by<a href="../level4/PTIIICOOR_CH32WASERE_ARTIVDUPUUT_DIV2RA.html#PTIIICOOR_CH32WASERE_ARTIVDUPUUT_DIV2RA_S32-64CHRA"> Section 32-64</a>. Payment of each fee shall be accompanied by a statement, verified by the public
               utility involved, showing its gross operating revenues upon which such service fee
               is computed. This statement shall be in such form and detail as the Board shall prescribe
               and shall be subject to audit by the County. The Board may refund any overpayment
               of any such fee and may require the utility to pay such additional amount as may be
               due in case of an underpayment. The service fee payable hereunder shall be used exclusively
               by the Water and Sewer Board to administer and regulate public utilities in Miami-Dade
