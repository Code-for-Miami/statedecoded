               The Board of County Commissioners finds that it is in the best interests of the County
               to ensure that employees who have knowledge of unlawful activity, misfeasance or malfeasance
               by the County or independent contractors report such knowledge to the appropriate
               authorities for investigation and corrective action. In order to encourage employees
               to report such information without fear of reprisal, it shall be the policy of the
               County to prohibit adverse action against an employee for disclosing such information
               to an appropriate official or agency and to award such employees when the information
               they disclose leads to the County's recovery of public funds.
