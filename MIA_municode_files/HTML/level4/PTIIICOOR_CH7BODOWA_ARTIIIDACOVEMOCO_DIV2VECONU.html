               tributaries, he shall so notify the record owner of the offending vessel or his lawful
               agent and the record owner of the said abutting land, or only the latter if the record
               owner of the offending vessel or his lawful agent cannot be ascertained, in writing
               and demand that such owners cause the condition to be remedied. The notices shall
               be given by registered mail, addressed to the owner or owners of the property described,

               States mail with proper postage prepaid. In the event that such notices are returned
               by postal authorities the Manager shall cause a copy of the notices to be served by
               a law enforcement officer upon the owner of the offending vessel or his lawful agent
               and upon the occupant of the land, the owner, or upon any agent of the owner thereof.

               agent or upon the occupant of the land, the owner, or upon any agent of the owner
               thereof cannot be performed after reasonable search by a law enforcement officer the

               If within twenty (20) days after the mailing or posting of the notices no hearing
               has been requested and the condition described in the notice has not been remedied,
               the County Manager shall cause the condition to be remedied by Dade County at the
               expense of either vessel owner or the land owner or both of these property owners,
               jointly or severally. If a hearing has been held and has been concluded adversely
               to either or both of these property owners, the County Manager may cause the condition
               to be remedied by Dade County at the expense of either or both of these property owners
               unless the Commission directs otherwise. Actions taken by the County Manager to remedy
               the said condition may include but are not limited to pumping out vessels, providing
               lines for vessels, installing cleats, bitts, bollards or pilings adequate to keep
               vessels securely moored, and removing and destroying vessels abandoned or left in
               a derelict condition and having only nominal or junk value. Persons designated by
               the Manager to remedy the said conditions are hereby expressly authorized to enter
               upon the said property described in the notices set out in<a href="../level4/PTIIICOOR_CH7BODOWA_ARTIIIDACOVEMOCO_DIV2VECONU.html#PTIIICOOR_CH7BODOWA_ARTIIIDACOVEMOCO_DIV2VECONU_S7-46NO"> Section 7-46</a> above. Upon ordering a condition to be remedied by the County, the County Manager
               shall cause to be recorded in the public records a notice of vessel mooring lien pending,
               which shall include a description of the vessel and land involved and a statement
               that the mooring of a vessel or its destruction in accordance with this article has
               been ordered, the cost of which shall under this article constitute a lien. The said
               notice of vessel mooring lien pending shall, twelve (12) months after the date thereof
               be null and void and constitute no record notice of a pending lien. After remedying
               the nuisance, the County Manager shall certify to the Director of Finance the expenses
               incurred in effecting the proper vessel mooring or destruction, and shall include
               a copy of the notice described in the preceding sentence, whereupon such expense shall
               become payable within thirty (30) days, after which a special assessment lien and
               charge will be made upon the vessel or land or both, together with costs of recordation
               of all documents required to be recorded hereby and with interest at the rate of six
               (6) percent per annum from the date of such certification until paid; provided however,
               that the said lien may be satisfied at any time by the payment of the entire sum due
               plus accrued interest, recordation costs, and such expenses and penalties as may result
               from the advertisement and sale of certificates for delinquent liens as hereinafter
               set out. The Director of Finance shall file for record a notice of lien pertaining
               to such lien in the office of the Clerk of the Circuit Court, and shall keep complete
               records relating to the amount payable thereon. The amount of liens accruing during
               any year ending on June first shall be billed and mailed in the fall of the same year
               to the owners of the vessel, the land, or both of these properties subject to such
               liens at the same time as tax statements for ad valorem taxes are mailed, and if the
               said amount shall not be paid on or before April first of the following year, the
               lien shall be delinquent, overdue, and in default, and the entire amount of the lien
               shall be collected in the same manner as delinquent taxes by advertisement and sale
               of certificates. Upon full payments of liens provided hereby or sale certificates
               resulting therefrom, the Director of Finance shall, by appropriate means, evidence
               the satisfaction and cancellation of such lien upon the public records. The cost of
               recordation of the notice of vessel mooring lien pending, the notice of lien, and
               the satisfaction of lien shall be secured by the lien hereby provided.
